Great question! The price for **Docker build and deployment services** varies **a LOT** depending on a few key factors:

---

### 1. **Freelancer vs. Agency**

* **Freelancer** (Upwork, Fiverr):

  * *Simple Dockerization & Deployment*: **\$100 – \$500**
  * *Full CI/CD Pipeline (with GitHub Actions, staging, prod, etc.)*: **\$500 – \$2,000**
  * *Kubernetes, multi-cloud, advanced setup*: **\$1,500+**

* **Boutique Agency or Specialist Firm**:

  * *Minimum engagement*: **\$2,000 – \$5,000** (even for small projects)
  * *Larger projects*: **\$5,000 – \$20,000+**

* **Big Consultancies (IBM, Accenture, etc.)**:

  * *Enterprise scale*: **\$20,000+**, sometimes much, much more (think corporate/enterprise contracts)

---

### 2. **Managed Hosting Platform with Setup Help**

* **Railway, Render, Heroku, DigitalOcean App Platform**:

  * *DIY*: You only pay for hosting (usually **\$5–\$25/month** per service)
  * *With initial setup help*: Sometimes free, sometimes **\$200–\$1,000** (via marketplace or partner agencies)

### 3. **What Are You Asking For?**

* **Just Dockerize my app**:

  * *Basic Dockerfile, docker-compose.yaml, instructions*: **\$100–\$400** (freelancer)
* **End-to-end: Build, Deploy, CI/CD, Cloud infra, Monitoring**:

  * **\$2,000–\$10,000+** (agency or experienced freelancer)
* **Ongoing DevOps (maintenance, upgrades, scaling)**:

  * *Monthly retainer*: **\$250–\$2,000/mo** depending on needs and SLA

---

### 4. **Examples from Upwork/Fiverr (2024)**

* “I will dockerize and deploy your Django app to DigitalOcean or AWS” – **\$200–\$750**
* “End-to-end CI/CD for Python, Docker, AWS, and Postgres” – **\$750–\$2,000**
* “Kubernetes production cluster setup” – **\$2,000–\$5,000** (often includes documentation and hand-off)

---

## **Bottom Line**

* **Freelancer, one-off setup**: **\$100–\$1,000**
* **Agency, custom pipeline**: **\$2,000+**
* **Ongoing support**: *add \$250–\$2,000/month* if needed

**Tip:**
If you *just want to get it deployed* for testing or demonstration, start with a freelancer or a “deployment gig.” For anything long-term, mission-critical, or enterprise, go with an agency or managed service.
