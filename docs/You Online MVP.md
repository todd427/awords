## **First Draft Plan: “You Online” MVP**

### **1. Vision**

A service that lets anyone create a digital version of themselves—a personalized AI avatar (text and/or voice)—to preserve their wisdom, humor, stories, and personality for their loved ones and for posterity.

---

### **2. Target Users**

* Writers, public figures, and anyone who wants their story remembered.
* Families seeking to preserve elders’ voices and memories.
* Estate planners, memoir services, family historians.
* Everyday people who want to leave a meaningful legacy.

---

### **3. MVP Features**

#### **A. User Onboarding**

* Sign up/login (email, Google, Apple, etc.)
* Simple dashboard: “Create Your Digital Self”

#### **B. Data Upload**

* Text input: upload documents, letters, stories, Q\&As, social posts.
* Guidance: “The more you share, the richer your avatar becomes.”

#### **C. LLM Avatar Creation**

* Use Hugging Face or similar to fine-tune an LLM on user data.
* Secure, private: each user’s model/data is separate and never public by default.
* “Chat with Yourself” page for immediate feedback.

#### **D. Voice Clone (Optional Premium)**

* Integrate with ElevenLabs/Resemble for users who upload voice samples.
* Approvals/verification for ethical voice cloning.
* “Hear Yourself” page—type any text, hear your voice reply.

#### **E. Access & Legacy Controls**

* “Who can access your avatar?”: Only you, specific people, public, or time-locked (“only after I’m gone”).
* Download/export your data and model.

#### **F. Security & Privacy**

* Encryption, strong access controls, and compliance with AI/voice ethics guidelines.

## **First Draft Pitch**

---

### **“You Online” — Preserve Your Voice. Pass On Your Wisdom.**

**What if you could talk to your grandfather again? What if your children could ask you anything, decades from now?**

*You Online* lets anyone create a living, interactive digital legacy:

* **A chat avatar, trained on your words, stories, and advice.**
* **Your real voice, brought back through advanced AI voice cloning.**

For families, it’s a way to keep wisdom and laughter alive for generations.
For individuals, it’s a chance to leave something deeper than photos or social media—an enduring presence, “for your grandkids and your descendants.”

---

**How it Works:**

1. **Upload your stories, emails, writings, and voice samples.**
2. **We train a private AI that thinks and sounds like you.**
3. **Choose who can interact: just family, close friends, or the world.**
4. **Set a legacy timer—release your avatar after you’re gone, or let people connect now.**

---

**Privacy, security, and ethics** are at the core of “You Online.” Your data is yours. Your avatar is only as public as you want. Everything is encrypted and can be downloaded for safe-keeping.

---

**The future of legacy is not a scrapbook.
It’s *you*, online—forever.**
