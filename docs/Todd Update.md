Absolutely! Here’s a **backgrounder draft** (in an informal, engaging tone) you can send to friends, or polish for your blog/newsletter. I’ll include a short, a medium, and a long version—so you can pick or combine as needed.

## **Short Version (for email, social, or intro blurb)**

I’ve just started an MSc in Cyberpsychology at ATU Letterkenny, diving deep into how technology and digital life shape our minds, behaviors, and society. It’s part psychology, part tech—and all about understanding the digital age from the inside out. I’ll be exploring everything from AI and social media to online identity, digital addiction, and the future of human-AI relationships.
If you’re curious about the intersection of mind and machine, stick around—plenty of stories, weird facts, and wild insights to come!

**What’s Todd up to now? Starting an MSc in Cyberpsychology!**

For those who know me as a sci-fi writer, programmer, and all-around digital tinkerer, this next step might seem right on brand—or maybe a little left field. I’ve enrolled in the MSc Cyberpsychology program at Atlantic Technological University (ATU) in Letterkenny, Ireland.

So what *is* cyberpsychology? Think of it as the psychology of how we live online: how social media changes the way we think and feel, why people fall for online scams, how AI and digital assistants are changing our relationships, and what it means to have a “self” in a virtual world. If you’ve ever wondered about digital addiction, online communities, the dark side of tech, or the ways AI is rewiring our brains—you’re in cyberpsychology territory.

Why am I doing this? Two reasons:

1. **Curiosity**—I’ve always been fascinated by how technology shapes us, both in fiction and real life.
2. **Relevance**—As AI and digital tools become more and more a part of everyday life (including my own projects!), I want to understand the human side: how people adapt, what makes tech helpful or harmful, and where we’re headed as a digital species.

I’ll be sharing my discoveries, reflections, and maybe the occasional “what is this world coming to?” rant along the way. If you have questions or ideas, let me know—I’d love to make this an ongoing conversation.

**Embarking on a New Adventure: My MSc in Cyberpsychology**

For most of my life, I’ve been obsessed with two things: storytelling (especially sci-fi and fantasy) and technology. Whether writing novels, coding web apps, or experimenting with AI, I’ve always been interested in the *human side* of technology—the stories we tell ourselves about the digital world, and the ways those stories change as the tech does.

That’s why, in 2025, I decided to pursue an MSc in Cyberpsychology at Atlantic Technological University in Letterkenny, Ireland.

### **What is Cyberpsychology?**

Cyberpsychology is the study of how digital technology affects the mind and behavior. It looks at everything from the way social media influences our moods and relationships, to how virtual reality can change our sense of self, to the new ethical questions posed by AI and digital assistants (like, say, ChatGPT).

In the program, I’ll be exploring questions like:

* How do we construct our identities online?
* What are the psychological effects of always-on social media and instant messaging?
* How does AI (from smart assistants to deepfakes) influence our decision-making and sense of trust?
* What happens to human connection in an era of screens and virtual worlds?
* Can technology be designed to support—not undermine—mental health and well-being?

### **Why This, and Why Now?**

We’re living through a time of radical change. Technology is everywhere, in everything. Our kids and grandkids will never know a world without the internet, AI, or social media. As someone who’s spent decades thinking about the future (and occasionally writing about dragon-filled planets), I want to understand *how* these digital forces are shaping our lives—and what we can do to ensure a healthy, humane digital world.

This degree is a chance to bring together my experience as a writer, coder, and (let’s face it) lifelong digital explorer, and channel it into real research, reflection, and maybe a few rants about the future we’re all building together.

### **What Comes Next?**

* I’ll be sharing interesting insights, research tidbits, and (of course) a few stories along the way.
* If you’re interested in the ways humans and tech collide, subscribe to my newsletter or follow my blog!
* And if you have questions about cyberpsychology, AI, or anything digital, send them my way. I’m all about conversation—after all, that’s where the best discoveries start.

Stay tuned for more as this adventure unfolds!
