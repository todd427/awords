## **Clone My Voice Plan — Using ElevenLabs**

---

### **Step 1: Prepare Your Voice Samples**

1. **Record yourself reading**

   * Use a good microphone in a quiet space.
   * Read various texts: stories, dialogue, conversational passages, narration.
   * Aim for at least **5 minutes** (the more, the better—up to 30 minutes gives a richer, more flexible clone).
2. **File format**

   * Save as WAV or high-bitrate MP3 (44.1kHz+, mono or stereo).
   * Try to have one or more files (multiple files are fine).

**Tip:**

* For best results, include a mix of your natural speaking, emotional tones, and conversational speech—don’t just read one book in monotone!

3. Confirm your account via email if required.

### **Step 3: Upload Your Voice**

1. Log into the ElevenLabs dashboard.
2. Go to **“VoiceLab”** (or "Create a Voice" in the menu).
3. Click **“Add Voice”** or **“Create Voice”**.
4. **Upload your audio files**

   * Give your voice a name (“Todd Legacy,” “Dad 2025,” etc.)
   * Optional: Add a description for future reference.
5. **Consent/Verification**

   * ElevenLabs will ask for a consent form and may prompt you to read a phrase for verification (to prove you are the owner of the voice).

---

### **Step 4: Wait for Processing**

* ElevenLabs processes your samples (typically 5–30 minutes for a new voice).
* You’ll get a notification when your voice clone is ready.

---

### **Step 5: Test Your Voice Clone**

1. Go to your new voice in VoiceLab.
2. Enter sample text in the “Text to Speech” box.
3. Click **Generate** or **Play**.
4. Listen—does it sound like you? Try different types of text and emotional tones.

---

### **Step 6: Refine (Optional but Recommended)**

* If the voice sounds “off,” try uploading additional or more varied audio.
* You can add more samples over time—dialogue, singing, laughter, etc.

---

### **Step 7: Use Your Voice Clone**

1. **Download generated audio** for use in audiobooks, videos, etc.
2. **Use the ElevenLabs API** to generate speech in your voice programmatically (great for integrating with chatbots, apps, or narration tools).

   * Docs: [https://docs.elevenlabs.io/](https://docs.elevenlabs.io/)
3. **Share or keep private**—you control who can access or hear your voice.

---

### **Step 8: Keep it Secure & Ethical**

* Only you (or trusted users) should have access to the clone.
* Consider documenting usage wishes (“only for audiobooks,” “for family,” etc.).
* Download and backup your voice model for your own archive.

---

## **Bonus: Combine with LLM**

* Connect your ElevenLabs voice with your “You Online” LLM avatar for a talking chatbot that sounds like you!
* This can be done via API—LLM generates text, ElevenLabs generates audio, your app serves it up as “Todd speaks.”

---

### **Estimated Time Needed:**

* **Recording/Preparation:** 15–60 minutes
* **Upload & Processing:** 5–30 minutes
* **Testing & Refinement:** 10–30 minutes
* **Integration (API):** As needed
