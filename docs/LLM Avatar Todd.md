Great question—and totally on point for 2025! Here’s what you need to know:

---

## 1. Creating a “Todd” LLM (Language Model Avatar)

### **What you want:**

* An AI that responds and writes like you (“Todd”)—knows your books, style, bio, history, opinions, etc.
* Ideally, something you (or your estate!) can run, own, or control.

### **How you can do it:**

* **Fine-tune an open-source LLM**: Use your writings, interviews, social posts, emails, etc., as training data. The bigger the dataset, the more accurate the avatar.

  * **Popular open models:** [Llama 3](https://llama.meta.com/llama3/), [Mistral](https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-7b/), [Phi-3](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/phi-3/), and others. These can be run locally or in the cloud.
* **Platforms & tools:**

  * [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) or [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)—for easy model hosting/fine-tuning.
  * [GPT-4o custom instructions](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6783457-how-can-i-customize-chatgpt) (for a less technical, more “profiled” avatar, but not full retraining).
  * [PersonalAI](https://personal.ai/): A startup that builds “digital twins” for people using chat-based learning. Meant for your kind of use case—private, personal, with your voice, memories, etc.

**Caveats:**

* Full fine-tuning is expensive and requires lots of quality data.
* Smaller models can run locally (even on a Mac/PC!) for fun experiments.
* You’ll still want “guardrails” and privacy controls.

## 2. Creating a Clone of Your Voice

### **What you want:**

* An AI that can *speak* as “Todd,” with your voice and intonation.
* Use it for audiobooks, videos, phone calls, whatever.

### **How you can do it:**

* **ElevenLabs** ([elevenlabs.io](https://elevenlabs.io/)): The best known for voice cloning. Give them a few minutes of high-quality audio, and you get a digital voice that’s nearly perfect.

  * **Features:** Supports “professional” and “casual” tones, emotion, multilingual. (You control the model; can keep it private.)
* **OpenAI Voice Engine**: Not widely available to the public yet, but it's coming. Will be *very* good, but potentially less “ownable.”
* **Resemble.ai** ([resemble.ai](https://www.resemble.ai/)): Another serious contender, especially if you want to license or embed your cloned voice into other apps.
* **Microsoft Azure AI Speech Studio**: Professional-grade, less friendly UI, but very capable for TTS and voice cloning.

**Caveats:**

* Most reputable services require you to prove you’re the person whose voice is being cloned.
* Be careful with permissions and copyright—your voice is valuable intellectual property!

## **Putting it all together**

You could absolutely have a “Todd” chatbot (web or mobile app) that:

* *Talks* like you (voice clone)
* *Thinks/writes* like you (custom LLM)
* *Knows* your work (plug in your bibliography, unpublished manuscripts, etc.)

**Let me know** if you want practical steps for:

* Fine-tuning (on Hugging Face, local, or PersonalAI)
* Voice clone walkthroughs (for ElevenLabs or Resemble)
* Integrating both into a “Todd” AI web app

---

**TL;DR:**

* Yes, you can create a Todd LLM avatar—using your own writing to train/fine-tune an LLM.
* Yes, you can clone your voice, best with ElevenLabs or Resemble.
* The combo is powerful, personal, and possible—2025 is the year for it.

Want a **step-by-step plan** for one (or both) of these? Or want to see a sample output? Just say the word!
