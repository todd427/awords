Totally understood!
**Google Slides (or PowerPoint) is a great choice for clean, editable, on-brand visuals—especially if you want to tweak layouts or share with a team.**

### Here’s what you can do:

1. **Copy the content/roadmap phases I wrote above.**
2. **Open Google Slides.**
3. **Create three columns (or boxes) for the phases:**

   * Photo Avatar
   * AI Video Avatar
   * 3D & Live Animation
4. **Paste the details under each.**
5. **Add a title (“AfterWords Visual Roadmap”) and subtitle (“From voice and text to a living, visual presence”).**
6. **Add the quote at the bottom:**
   “With AfterWords Visuals, your legacy speaks, smiles, and lives on—today and forever.”
