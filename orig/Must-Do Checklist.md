Crystal clear! Here’s your **hardcore technical/product-first task list** for the next month—**before** you worry about website, landing page, or PR.
This is all about getting a real, working “Todd” AfterWords MVP avatar (text + voice) in place, and setting yourself up for success on data prep/cleaning (your secret weapon!).

## **Next-Month Must-Do Checklist: AfterWords MVP (Product-First)**

---

### **A. LLM Avatar (Text “Todd”)**

#### **1. LLM Model Selection**

* [ ] Evaluate: Ollama (local), Hugging Face (hosted/fine-tuning), Llama 3, Mistral, or similar open-source LLMs.
* [ ] Decide on:

  * Model to use
  * Hosting (local or cloud)
  * Fine-tuning vs. prompt-profiling

#### **2. Data Acquisition & Cleaning**

* [ ] Collect *all* your material: books, stories, blog posts, essays, Q\&A, etc.
* [ ] Convert/export to `.txt` or `.docx`—prefer plain text
* [ ] **Deduplicate** (remove repeated stories, chapters, blog posts)
* [ ] **Clean formatting** (strip headers/footers, page numbers, weird line breaks, OCR errors)
* [ ] **Split long docs** if needed (chapters, emails, scenes, Q\&A)
* [ ] **Remove sensitive/unwanted passages**
* [ ] Organize by category (narrative, advice, Q\&A, fiction, bio)
* [ ] Build a single, master “training corpus” (or multiple, if experimenting)

#### **3. LLM Training/Profiling**

* [ ] Prepare data in format needed for model (plain text, prompt-response, etc.)
* [ ] Fine-tune LLM (or set up prompt-based “persona” if fine-tuning is too slow/expensive)
* [ ] Test on:

  * Q\&A
  * Storytelling
  * Advice
  * Style imitation
* [ ] Record strengths/weaknesses and iterate: add more data, re-clean, retrain as needed

### **B. ElevenLabs Voice Clone**

#### **1. Voice Sample Prep**

* [ ] Record 5–30 minutes of high-quality, varied audio

  * Read from your own work
  * Include both narration and conversation, some emotion
* [ ] Save as WAV/MP3, clean up noise if possible
* [ ] Organize samples (label if possible: “reading,” “Q\&A,” “memoir,” etc.)

#### **2. ElevenLabs Voice Training**

* [ ] Create/log into ElevenLabs account
* [ ] Upload voice samples
* [ ] Consent/identity check as required
* [ ] Wait for processing (repeat if needed)
* [ ] Test: enter text, generate speech, listen for accuracy
* [ ] If flat/off, record more, upload, repeat

### **C. Data Cleaning/Processing (The Big Advantage)**

#### **1. Build Data Cleaning Pipeline**

* [ ] Script for removing junk, duplicates, OCR/scan errors, email signatures, etc.
* [ ] Script for segmenting long documents into sensible, context-rich chunks
* [ ] Optionally: Tag parts of the corpus (dialogue, memoir, advice, bio)
* [ ] Tool to preview and manually approve “final” training set

#### **2. Document Process**

* [ ] Record every cleaning/prep step (so it’s repeatable for users/customers later)
* [ ] Build modular scripts (so you can scale for future onboarding)

#### **3. Evaluate Output**

* [ ] Randomly sample cleaned data for sanity check
* [ ] Adjust scripts/settings as needed
* [ ] Save “gold standard” training dataset

### **D. Early Integration (MVP Loop)**

* [ ] Set up local script or tiny Flask/FastAPI app to:

  * Upload/copy text data
  * Submit sample questions, get LLM answers
  * Pipe answer to ElevenLabs, get and play back audio
* [ ] Validate end-to-end: Can you talk to your own digital twin, text & voice?

---

### **E. Minimal UI/UX (for Testing Only)**

* [ ] Simple CLI or web form to upload data and interact with LLM+voice

---

### **Your Deliverable by Month’s End:**

* Working “Todd” digital avatar:

  * You can chat with it, and it sounds and speaks like you
* Clean, documented data pipeline ready for future users
* All core tech choices and scripts tested, documented, and reproducible

**Ignore web design, PR, and public signup until you have this “core loop” running.**
This is exactly what will give you a real, defensible, “magic moment” demo and product base.
