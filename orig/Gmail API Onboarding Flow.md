No worries at all! (And I 100% agree—multi-line text areas are vastly under-appreciated 😁.)

Here’s your **outline for Gmail API onboarding**—from user click to email ingestion, in a way that’s friendly, secure, and privacy-forward.

---

## **AfterWords: Gmail API Onboarding Flow (User Outline)**

---

### **Step 1: Invite User to Connect Gmail**

* **In the onboarding dashboard, show:**

  * “Connect your Gmail to import your best stories and Q\&A.”
  * List what you’ll do:

    * “We’ll only access your ‘Sent Mail’ (or selected folders).”
    * “You control what’s imported, and you can disconnect anytime.”

* **\[Connect Gmail] button** triggers OAuth2 workflow.

---

### **Step 2: Secure Google Login (OAuth2)**

* User clicks **\[Connect Gmail]**.
* Redirect to Google’s OAuth2 consent screen.

  * **Scopes:**

    * Read-only access to user’s Gmail (ideally restricted to “Sent Mail” or user-chosen labels).
    * (Explain what’s needed: no reading of inbox, contacts, calendar, etc.)
* User logs in and grants permission.

---

### **Step 3: AfterWords Receives Access Token**

* Your backend stores an encrypted token (for the user only).
* Immediately begins Gmail API sync.

---

### **Step 4: Guided Email Import/Selection**

* Show user a summary of:

  * Total “Sent” emails found
  * Most recent/frequent correspondents
  * Filters: by date range, sender, recipient, subject/label, etc.

* **Let the user choose:**

  * Import all, or only specific senders/topics/date ranges.
  * (Optional) Preview before import.

---

### **Step 5: Cleaning & Processing (Background)**

* After user selection:

  * Download selected emails via Gmail API.
  * Run cleaning pipeline: remove signatures, quoted text, non-replies, etc.
  * Identify Q\&A pairs where possible.

* (Optional) Show “progress bar” or “number of emails imported and processed.”

---

### **Step 6: User Review & Edit**

* Present a sample of the imported/cleaned emails.
* Allow user to:

  * Exclude/edit any messages they don’t want in their avatar
  * Redact specific information if desired
  * Confirm/import final set

---

### **Step 7: Training & Integration**

* Add cleaned data to user’s LLM training set.
* Show completeness/progress score:

  * “You’ve added 25,000 words from Gmail—great start!”
* Optionally: Suggest other data streams (docs, memoir, interviews) to improve further.

---

### **Step 8: Privacy Controls & Disconnect**

* Remind user:

  * “You can disconnect Gmail access anytime from your profile.”
  * “We only use imported emails for your avatar—never for ads or outside sharing.”

---

## **Technical/Compliance Notes**

* Use **OAuth2**—never ask for user passwords.
* Store tokens securely (encrypted, per-user).
* Make it simple for users to revoke permission (and delete imported data).
* Be transparent and privacy-forward at every step.

---

### **Summary User Flow**

1. Connect Gmail
2. Approve access on Google
3. Select which emails to import
4. Review/clean imported emails
5. Confirm import and build avatar
6. (At any time: disconnect and remove data)
