### **Welcome to AfterWords!**

*Leave a Legacy That Will Last Forever.*

#### **Your journey starts here. Let’s build your digital legacy together.**

#### **How It Works:**

**1. Upload Your Stories**
*Your avatar learns from the words you share.*

* Letters, memoirs, emails, stories, advice columns, even journals.
* The more you add, the more “you” your AfterWords avatar becomes.

**Minimum:** 5,000 words (about 10 pages)
**Recommended:** 50,000+ words (a lifetime of wisdom)

**2. Add Your Voice (Optional, for a Talking Avatar)**

* Record or upload 5–30 minutes of clear audio.
* Read stories, answer questions, or just talk about your life.

**3. Review and Personalize**

* See your progress and completeness score.
* Add a short bio, a favorite quote, or set the mood for your avatar.
* You’ll get a preview of how your avatar “sounds.”

**4. Privacy and Legacy Settings**

* You choose who can interact with your avatar:

  * Just you
  * Family & friends
  * Public (future generations)
* You control when it’s unlocked:

  * Now
  * After a chosen date/event
