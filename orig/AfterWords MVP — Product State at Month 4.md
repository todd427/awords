Excellent question! At **month 4** (when the largest investment is “sunk” and you’re about to start generating revenue), here’s what you should have, assuming you follow the **AfterWords MVP roadmap**:

---

## **AfterWords MVP — Product State at Month 4**

### **Core Functionalities Ready**

1. **User Onboarding & Dashboard**

   * Users can sign up, log in, and access a private dashboard.
   * Simple, professional landing page, likely with a waitlist or early access option.

2. **Writing/Content Upload**

   * Users can upload `.docx`, `.txt`, or paste in their own writing.
   * Files are stored securely, associated with the user account.
   * (Optional, if MVP scope allows): Upload emails, social posts, or other content types.

3. **LLM Avatar (Text)**

   * Each user has an AI “avatar” trained or profiled on their writing.
   * Basic chat UI: users can interact with their avatar (Q\&A, “ask my past self,” etc.).
   * LLM model runs securely (self-hosted or Hugging Face pipeline).
   * Replies “sound like them” (or you, in the demo case).

4. **Voice Integration (Optional/Alpha)**

   * Users can (optionally) record/upload voice samples.
   * ElevenLabs integration: simple “type to speak” (enter text, get their voice audio).
   * At least one working demo (your own avatar, for show & tell).
   * Consent/identity workflow in place for ethical voice cloning.

5. **Basic Privacy/Legacy Controls**

   * Users set privacy: “Only me,” “Family/friends,” or “Public.”
   * Legacy/“unlock after X” UI (might not be fully automated, but the control exists).

6. **Admin/Owner Demo Tools**

   * You have an admin dashboard to monitor, approve, or demo users and content.
   * Your “Todd” avatar is available for pitch/demo.

### **What You *May Not* Have Yet**

* Fully polished UI (may be minimal or utilitarian)
* Mobile app or advanced front-end
* Granular legacy triggers (e.g., legal integration, timed unlocks)
* Automated onboarding for family members or advanced account linking
* Analytics, payments, or in-app upgrades (unless a must-have)

---

### **What You *Do Have* For Demo & First Users**

* A functioning web app with real, usable “digital twin” avatars
* At least one impressive demo user (yourself, with text & voice)
* Voice avatar works (with ElevenLabs), even if only for a few users
* Real conversations: you can “talk to yourself” and get answers in your own style/voice

---

**Summary:**

> By month 4, you have a working, impressive, end-to-end MVP:
>
> * Users can join, upload, and “talk to themselves” via LLM.
> * At least one (your) avatar can *speak* using ElevenLabs.
> * Privacy controls and basic legacy UI are present.
> * You have a full product flow for show & tell, early feedback, and real learning.

**This is exactly when to begin onboarding select early users, demoing for partners/investors, or running a mini-launch.**
