## **I. Text/LLM Avatar: Build Your “Voice” in Words**

### **Step 1: Gather Your Material**

* [ ] Collect all writing you want to include:

  * Books, stories, articles, essays
  * Emails, letters, journals, blog posts
  * Interviews, Q\&A, advice columns
  * Social media posts (optional)
* [ ] Organize content by type or era if possible (helps with fine-tuning and later features)

### **Step 2: Prepare Your Files**

* [ ] Convert all material to `.docx` or `.txt` (plain text is best; separate files for each source or topic if possible)
* [ ] Remove any content you do NOT want in your avatar (sensitive/private stuff)
* [ ] Make sure files are readable—no formatting glitches

### **Step 3: Upload to AfterWords**

* [ ] Log into your AfterWords dashboard (or the dev version!)
* [ ] Use the upload tool to submit all writing files
* [ ] Confirm total word count (aim for at least 5,000 words; ideally 50,000+)

### **Step 4: Review and Edit (Optional)**

* [ ] Check your uploaded material for accuracy
* [ ] Add a short “About Me” or biography for context
* [ ] Tag any material that’s especially “you” or you want prioritized (optional)

### **Step 5: LLM Training**

* [ ] Start the “Train My Avatar” process
* [ ] Wait for confirmation (may take a few minutes or hours depending on data)
* [ ] Chat with your avatar and see how it responds!
* [ ] Note any major quirks, missing info, or awkwardness—these can guide future uploads

## **II. Voice Avatar: Train Your ElevenLabs Clone**

### **Step 6: Prepare Your Voice Samples**

* [ ] Find a quiet space and a decent mic (USB or smartphone works)
* [ ] Record 5–30 minutes of audio:

  * Read some of your uploaded stories/letters
  * Speak conversationally—add greetings, questions, and answers
  * Use natural intonation and some emotion

### **Step 7: Upload to ElevenLabs**

* [ ] Create/log into your ElevenLabs account
* [ ] Go to VoiceLab → “Create a Voice”
* [ ] Upload your audio files (WAV or MP3)
* [ ] Fill out required consent/identity prompts

### **Step 8: Test & Refine**

* [ ] Wait for processing (5–30 min)
* [ ] Use the text-to-speech box: type a question and play your clone’s response
* [ ] If the voice is off, record and upload additional or more varied samples

### **Step 9: Connect LLM & Voice**

* [ ] In AfterWords, link your LLM avatar to your ElevenLabs voice (via API or manual connection)
* [ ] Test by chatting with your avatar and clicking “Hear this in my voice”

### **Step 10: Review & Finalize**

* [ ] Try a range of questions (facts, opinions, memories, advice)
* [ ] Ask friends or family to test and give feedback
* [ ] Add or edit material as needed to fill any gaps

### **Step 11: Set Privacy & Legacy Preferences**

* [ ] Choose who can access your avatar (just you, family, public, etc.)
* [ ] Set any unlock or legacy preferences (“release after…”)
* [ ] Complete your onboarding checklist—see your “completeness” bar hit 100%!
