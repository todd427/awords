* It’s a cutting-edge, positive, future-facing project—“a living autobiography.”
* For up-and-comers: Makes you *more memorable* in a crowded field (first actor/influencer with a digital twin!)

## **Early Adopter/Influencer “Pitch”**

> “Be among the first to create an interactive, living legacy—your fans and family can ask you anything, now and for generations to come. You’ll help pioneer the future of memory, story, and voice.”

## **Bonus: Pitch to Estates**

Don’t overlook literary, music, or film estates—families/agents controlling the legacy of beloved but departed icons (Leonard Nimoy, Sally Ride, Carrie Fisher, etc.).
**For them, AfterWords is a way to keep their loved one’s story and spirit alive for future generations.**
