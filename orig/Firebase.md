
1. Firebase Auth: What Is It, Why Use It?

Firebase Auth is Google’s authentication-as-a-service product.

    Purpose: Quickly and securely add login/signup to your web or mobile app, without having to manage passwords, security, social logins, etc.

    Features:

        Email/password, Google, Apple, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, and anonymous logins out of the box.

        Handles password resets, email verification, and session persistence.

        Client libraries for React, Next.js, mobile, etc.

        Secure—backed by Google infrastructure.

    For MVPs and SaaS:

        Lightning fast setup.

        Scales automatically.

        Can tie directly into user profile data (store onboarding completeness, uploads, privacy settings, etc.).

        Free for up to 10k active users/month; pricing is very startup-friendly.

    Downsides:

        Ties your user authentication to Google’s cloud (some prefer open-source/self-hosted for full control).

        Limited to the authentication layer—you’ll need a separate database for avatars, uploads, etc. (but Firebase Firestore or Realtime DB can handle this, or you can use Django/Postgres/MySQL etc.)
