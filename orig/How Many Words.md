Great question—this is foundational for setting expectations, onboarding users, and ensuring high avatar quality. Here’s what you need to know, with real numbers and practical guidance:

## **How Many Words for Training a Personal LLM?**

### **Minimum, Maximum, Optimum**

#### **Absolute Minimum (Barely Works):**

* **\~5,000 words** (about 10 single-spaced pages)
* Will produce a basic “flavor” of your style, but will be generic and limited in range.
* Useful for demos/proof-of-concept only.

#### **Practical Minimum (Usable, Feels “Personal”):**

* **\~20,000–30,000 words** (roughly 30–50 single-spaced pages)
* Enough for some nuance: an avatar that can answer a range of questions, repeat catchphrases, and start to feel like *you*.

#### **Optimum (Rich, Realistic Avatar):**

* **\~50,000–150,000+ words** (novella length up to a novel or a year’s worth of emails, essays, etc.)
* Avatar can hold deeper, more varied conversations, recall personal stories, and convincingly mimic your style and thought process.
* Authors/journalists will have no trouble hitting this; for regular users, combine memoir, Q\&A, and correspondence.

#### **Maximum (Realistically Useful):**

* **500,000–1,000,000+ words** (for superusers, prolific writers, or long-lived public figures)
* More is good—but with diminishing returns. Modern LLM fine-tuning may “see” up to a few million words, but training time and cost go up, and most value is captured in the first 100k–200k.

## **What Kind of Text is Best?**

### **Most Valuable**

* **First-person writing:** memoir, journals, personal essays, letters, email threads.
* **Q\&A/interview transcripts:** The AI learns how you answer real questions.
* **Advice columns, FAQs:** Great for “wisdom” or legacy advice.

### **Also Valuable**

* **Fiction:** Shows your style, themes, dialogue.
* **Speeches, blog posts, op-eds:** Public-facing tone and personality.
* **Social posts (if in your “voice”):** Tweets, Facebook, threads.

### **Less Valuable**

* **Technical writing/manuals:** Not personal, rarely “you.”
* **Marketing copy (unless it’s personal):** Can be bland.
* **Scanned images/PDFs without OCR:** Require extra processing.

## **For Best Results**

* **Mix styles and formats:** Letters, essays, Q\&A, story scenes.
* **Include both formal and informal writing.**
* **Remove (or tag) anything you don’t want the avatar to echo.**
* **Optionally:** Add metadata/tags (date, topic, mood) if you want future features (e.g., “What did I think in 2018?”).

## **Quick Reference Table**

| Use Case      | Words      | Result                                   |
| ------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Demo Only     | 5,000      | Basic flavor, generic answers            |
| Usable Avatar | 20–30,000  | Some nuance, recognizable style          |
| Optimum       | 50–150,000 | Deep, realistic, broad topic coverage    |
| Power User    | 500,000+   | Rich, but diminishing returns after 200k |

**Pro Tip:**

* For first-time onboarding, “strongly recommend” users upload at least 20k–30k words and show a progress bar towards 50k+.
* The **more conversational/Q\&A material you include, the more lifelike and interactive your avatar will be**—not just a monologue machine!
