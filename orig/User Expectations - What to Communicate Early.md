That’s exactly right—**user expectations** and **minimum input requirements** are *critical* for satisfaction with an AI avatar, especially for something as personal as legacy.

Here’s how to address both:

---

## **User Expectations: What to Communicate Early**

**1. “Your AI is only as rich as the stories you give it.”**

* The more material (letters, stories, emails, voice samples), the more authentic and helpful the avatar.
* Let users know up front: *less content = more generic, more content = more “you.”*

**2. “It can only answer what it’s learned.”**

* If you want it to give advice, upload advice columns or emails.
* If you want it to sound like your fiction, upload your stories.
* Be clear that **privacy and control** are always in their hands.

**3. “This is a living archive, not an oracle.”**

* It can surprise and delight, but it’s not a mind-reader or a perfect twin.

## **Minimum Acceptable Checklist**

This is a *hard floor* to ensure quality. Show the user their “completeness” score as they upload content!

### **Text Content (for a Useful Avatar)**

* **Absolute minimum:**

  * *5,000 words* (about 10 single-spaced pages; enough for basic “flavor”)
* **Recommended:**

  * *50,000+ words* (novella, collection of stories/essays, or a year’s worth of emails)
  * *100,000+ words* (novel, lifetime of correspondence, etc.)

### **Types of Material**

* **Strongest:**

  * First-person writing (letters, emails, memoir, journal)
  * Q\&A or advice (so avatar can answer questions “in your style”)
* **Helpful:**

  * Fiction, essays, speeches, interviews
* **Optional:**

  * Social posts, poetry, even text message logs

### **Voice**

* **Minimum:**

  * 5 minutes of clear, varied audio (reading, conversation, Q\&A)
* **Ideal:**

  * 15–30 minutes, with both reading and natural, conversational tone

## **Set Proper Expectations in Product Copy**

**“The more you share, the more ‘you’ your AfterWords avatar becomes.”**
**“Want it to tell your favorite stories? Upload them! Want it to give advice? Paste in your best advice emails.”**
**“Quality improves as you add more. Start small, and build your legacy over time.”**
