**Thunderbird emails are an *excellent* starting point**—especially because:

* They’re already on your local machine, not trapped in a cloud.
* Thunderbird’s standard format (mbox or separate .eml files) is well-documented and script-friendly.
* You control the data and can filter/export by folder, tag, or time period.

**IMAP (recent emails) is also fine:** You can use Thunderbird’s built-in tools to sync, export, or filter new emails from multiple accounts.

## **How Many Emails for Workflow Testing?**

**You don’t need “all of them” to get started.**
For workflow prototyping and initial LLM tests:

* **Good starter batch:** **50–200 emails** (ideally replies to questions, or your best “advice”/conversation threads)

  * That’s enough to debug cleaning, parsing, formatting, and see if the results “feel like you.”
  * You can always scale up to thousands once the pipeline works.

**For actual model training:**

* Even a few hundred high-quality, question/answer-rich emails can make a meaningful difference in your digital twin’s Q\&A ability.
* Eventually, aim for several thousand—but only after your cleaning/evaluation workflow is nailed down.

## **Suggested Steps**

1. **Export 100–200 “Sent” emails from Thunderbird** (pick a folder, recent year, or a label you like).
2. **Review a sample:** Make sure you’re seeing your *own* replies (not bulk forwards or spam).
3. **Clean/test:**

   * Remove sigs/footers/quoted threads
   * Optional: Pair each reply with the incoming question (if available)
   * Save as CSV/JSONL: “question”, “answer”, “date”, “stream=‘email’”
4. **Try in the LLM workflow:** Use for prompt-testing (“How would Todd reply to this?”).

## **Why This Works**

* **Small batch:** Easy to debug, hand-review, tweak cleaning scripts.
* **Local:** No privacy risk; you’re in full control.
* **Representative:** A few dozen emails often cover the main “modes” of your voice and advice.

## **When to Scale Up**

* Once you’re happy with the pipeline, move up to **1,000–10,000 emails** for real training.
* **Automate cleaning, but always review a random sample!**

---

**Bottom line:**

* **Thunderbird “Sent” mail: perfect.**
* **Start with 100–200 for workflow.**
* **Scale up once you’re confident the process is solid.**
