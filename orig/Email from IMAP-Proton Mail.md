Great news—**IMAP access with Proton Mail** (and most modern email providers) still gives you *excellent* flexibility for exporting, even if your Thunderbird archive is on another machine. Here’s how you can proceed:

---

## **A. Exporting Email from IMAP/Proton Mail**

### **1. Get Your IMAP Credentials for Proton Mail**

* Proton Mail uses a special “bridge” app for IMAP/SMTP access, because they encrypt mail end-to-end.
* **Download and install [Proton Mail Bridge](https://proton.me/mail/bridge)** on your main computer.
* Set up the bridge and get the IMAP settings for your Proton account (the app provides localhost credentials).

### **2. Connect a Mail Client (Thunderbird/Outlook/Apple Mail) via IMAP**

* Configure your mail client to connect to Proton Mail Bridge’s local IMAP server.
* Sync/download the folders you want (e.g., Sent, special tags, etc.).
* **Optional:** You can do this on the machine you’re using for your project—even if your main Thunderbird archive is elsewhere.

### **3. Exporting Emails**

* In Thunderbird, you can select emails and right-click > Save As > EML files (one per email).
* Or use an export add-on (e.g., ImportExportTools NG) to export entire folders to `.mbox` or `.eml` format.
* Many other clients (Outlook, Apple Mail) have similar export options.

## **B. Automating/Scripted Export (for Larger Batches)**

If you want to script it (good for *many* emails or repeated use):

* **Use Python’s `imaplib` library** to connect to the IMAP server (via Proton Mail Bridge).

  * Download and save selected emails (by date, folder, or sender).
  * Save as plain text, .eml, or parse directly into a cleaner script.

**Python IMAP sample (pseudocode):**

```python
import imaplib
import email

mail = imaplib.IMAP4_SSL("localhost", 1143)  # Use Proton Mail Bridge settings
mail.login("your-proton-username", "your-bridge-password")
mail.select("Sent")  # or "INBOX" or another folder

result, data = mail.search(None, "ALL")
for num in data[0].split():
    result, msg_data = mail.fetch(num, '(RFC822)')
    msg = email.message_from_bytes(msg_data[0][1])
    # Save/process msg as needed
```

* You can filter by subject, date, sender, etc., to narrow the batch.

## **C. How Many Emails to Export for Your First Test?**

* Start with **100–200** “Sent” emails (just as with Thunderbird).
* Pick a recent year, or emails matching certain keywords/tags (“advice,” “questions,” etc.).
* Export to `.eml`, `.mbox`, or even as text.

## **D. Next Steps**

1. **Set up Proton Mail Bridge and connect your email client on your project machine.**
2. **Export a small batch of Sent mail.**
3. **Test your cleaning and formatting process.**
4. **Iterate and expand batch as needed.**

**Proton Mail with Bridge** makes this process *secure* (no plaintext stored on their servers; only decrypted on your machine) and easy to automate.
