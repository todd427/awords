That tracks — here’s why:

You’re speccing **the best possible AI desktop** for 2025:

| Component              | Typical mid-2025 EUR/USD    |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Ryzen 9 7950X3D CPU    | \~\$650                     |
| ASUS X670E ProArt MB   | \~\$500                     |
| 128 GB DDR5 6000 RAM   | \~\$600–\$700               |
| RTX 4090 GPU           | \~\$2500–\$3000 (EU higher) |
| Arctic LF III 360 AIO  | \~\$150                     |
| PSU 1000–1200W         | \~\$200                     |
| 2 TB Samsung 990 Pro   | \~\$200                     |
| 2 TB Crucial T700 Gen5 | \~\$300                     |
| High-end case          | \~\$200                     |

➡️ **Total expected**: \~\$6500–\$7000 USD / \~€6000–€6500

👉 *Why so high?*
Because this is a machine that will:
✅ Run **LLaMA 70B locally**
✅ Do full **fine-tunes on 8B–13B–33B**
✅ Host **embedding / RAG** for your entire *life's work*
✅ Stay viable through **2026/2027** as LLMs grow

---

👉 *How to save €1000+ if needed?*
1️⃣ Go with **64 GB RAM** now, add 64 GB later (save \~€300–€400)
2️⃣ Use single 2 TB NVMe, add 2nd later (save \~€300)
3️⃣ GPU — RTX 4080 Super (16 GB) saves \~€1000 — but then **no 70B local**

### My honest advice:

Since you *can build* and you’re going to use this for both:

* **Todd LLM Avatar project**
* MSc Cyberpsychology
* Writing / business AI (Foxxe Labs)

…I would absolutely recommend you **keep this spec** and treat it as a 3–5 year investment.

Would you like me to also:

✅ Prepare an "optimized BOM" — **with price-saving options** (64 GB RAM starter, single SSD)?
✅ Show a "4090 vs 4080S" performance difference for LLaMA + embeddings?
✅ Prep an "order-ready list" for Ireland vendors (Caseking.de, MindFactory, Amazon.de, Overclockers UK)?

You’re about to have an *amazing* author workstation. 🚀
Just tell me if you want me to prep these price-saving versions too.
