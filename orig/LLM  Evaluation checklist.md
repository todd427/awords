Excellent priorities—**evaluation and portability** are everything at this stage.

## **LLM Evaluation Checklist**

**Purpose:** Find the best model (or process) for your “personal avatar” use case and ensure your approach stays portable if you want to switch models later.

---

### **1. Core Criteria**

* [ ] **Can you run it locally or via API?**

  * Ollama, Hugging Face, cloud LLM, or OpenAI?
* [ ] **Does it support custom fine-tuning or “persona”/prompt injection?**
* [ ] **What is the data format for training/profiling?**

  * (Plain text? Q\&A pairs? JSONL? Conversation history?)

---

### **2. Functionality**

* [ ] **Does it answer questions accurately and in your style?**
* [ ] **Can it mimic your tone—humor, story, advice, etc.?**
* [ ] **Does it handle context (multiple turns, long stories, Q\&A)?**
* [ ] **How “safe” is it—does it avoid hallucinations or inappropriate answers?**
* [ ] **Latency:** How fast does it reply (for both testing and eventual use)?
* [ ] **Resource usage:** Can you run/train on your available hardware/cloud?

---

### **3. Training & Maintenance**

* [ ] **How easy is it to add more data and retrain/re-profile?**
* [ ] **How do you monitor/improve model performance over time?**
* [ ] **Does it support multi-user onboarding (for future scale-up)?**

---

### **4. Portability/Future-proofing**

* [ ] **Can you export/import data and retrain on another LLM if needed?**
* [ ] **Is your data format generic (plain text, JSON, CSV, etc.)?**
* [ ] **Does your pipeline keep source docs and metadata?**

---

### **5. User Experience**

* [ ] **How easy is it to deploy in a test UI or integrate with a voice pipeline?**
* [ ] **Does it work for both Q\&A and freeform chat?**
* [ ] **Can you script/automate batch tests (for future QA)?**

---

### **6. Ethics & Privacy**

* [ ] **Is user data secure?**
* [ ] **Can you delete/update a model if the user wants?**
* [ ] **Are there clear logs/controls for privacy review?**

---

## **LLM Evaluation Scenarios (For Testing)**

* Ask it to summarize a story, then tell it in your style.
* Ask “What would you say to a young writer?” (advice test)
* Try long-context chat (3–5 turns on a topic)
* Try “tell me something you’ve never told anyone” (checks for imagination/creativity)
* See how it handles “I don’t know” or boundaries.
* Feed it a prompt with subtlety (“Tell me why Cody made that choice in chapter 2”)

---

## **Generic Data Cleaning for Maximum Portability**

**YES!**
**Generic, modular data cleaning is key.**

* **Save cleaned data as plain text, CSV, or JSONL (one chunk or Q\&A per line/row)**
* **Keep original document names, types, and metadata in a companion file or field**
* **Avoid LLM-specific markup (no OpenAI/Anthropic/Meta custom formatting)**

### **Recommended Steps:**

* [ ] Remove headers/footers, repeated lines, obvious scan/OCR errors.
* [ ] Deduplicate (exact/near-duplicate paragraphs or emails).
* [ ] Normalize line breaks and spacing.
* [ ] Strip out or tag meta-comments (“END OF CHAPTER”, “Page X”).
* [ ] Split into reasonable segments (e.g., <2,000 words/segment; shorter for Q\&A).
* [ ] (Optional) Save as both a “raw” and “cleaned” version for reprocessing.
* [ ] Document all cleaning steps and scripts.

**Result:**
You’ll have a **universal “training set”** you can feed to any modern LLM, and if you need to switch from, say, Llama 3 to Mistral or OpenAI, you only tweak the “import” step—not your whole pipeline.

**Want code examples for cleaning, or a sample JSONL format that works for most LLMs?**
Or a fillable “LLM comparison table”?
Just tell me which step you want next!
