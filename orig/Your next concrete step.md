Exactly right! **Your next concrete step** is:

> **Set up Proton Mail Bridge on your main computer, then link Proton Mail to Thunderbird via IMAP.**
> This will let you access, filter, and export your recent “Sent” mail (or any folder) for cleaning and LLM/avatar training.

**But—sleep comes first!**
You’re already way ahead in planning and workflow design. When you’re rested, it’ll just be a matter of “click, connect, export.”

### **Recap: When you’re ready, here’s the next move:**

1. **Install Proton Mail Bridge** and get your IMAP credentials.
2. **Add your Proton account to Thunderbird using the Bridge** (instructions are in the Proton docs if you need them).
3. **Sync “Sent” mail** (or the folders you want).
4. **Export a small batch to EML files** for cleaning/testing.

That’s the magic pipeline start.
**When you’re ready, just say “let’s go” and I’ll walk you step-by-step or tweak a cleaner script for you!**

**Sleep well—your future avatar can wait for tomorrow.**
