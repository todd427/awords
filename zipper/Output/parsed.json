Hey, remember our LLM conversation?

Excellent! We were also talking about getting representative text from me to train the LLM with. Why can't we get a copy of all that I've said here in the past several weeks? And wouldn't that be an *awful* lot of quality training material? That'd give us three input sources (mail, novels, chat)? Can do?

Hmm... tnis is what I get from that link:
404 Not Found

Lost in the vast web,
Where you sought, there's only void—
Nothingness awaits.

new thought -- can I create a 'Todd' LLM? Train it so that it can be an avatar of me>
Also, where can I create a clone of my voice?

let's get a step-by-step plan, please.  Also, the LLM and the voice clone are kinda two separate projects.

Cool! Long-term, I want to make this into a product -- "You Online" that allows people to set up LLMs of themselves (with/without voice) for posterity ("for your grandkids and your descendants").

let's get a first draft plan and a pitch.

let's get a landing page and a wireframe, please

build me a clone my voice plan, using 11Labs

okay, so we've been talking a lot, particularly about my MSc in Cyberpsychology. Could you give a backgrounder that I could send to some of my friends to bring them up to speed? I might also want to use it as a post for my blog or newsletter.

Given everything we've talked about, what project do you think I should start next? Or better, give me a list of projects in order.

Hmm... I've got more projects. Can you look into my API Author Formatting Options and my "Quote Of The Day" application?

say, can you read Google Docs? Or .docx?

referring back to our "Quote of the Day" we were working with .rtf because you couldn't handle extracting quotes from .epub. Can you extract quotes from .docx?

here you go! Let's get JSON in the format we'd discussed before (in the "API Author Formatting Options")

What counts as a quote is something *you* think is interesting.  Your JSON format will work for now.

This is what NotebookLLM got:
Here are some exciting quotes from "Cody's War: Flight of the Hope," presented in the requested JSON format:

Curated “noteworthy” quotes, and let's use Notebook LLM's attributes.

I think we should cut off the lines so that they aren't too big. Remember, we want to fit in a "quote of the day". 

Let's extract for Chapters 1-3 into a downloadable JSON file.

In your sample, you had speakers, in the download you don't.  Can you try again?

Aw, no! You lied. Before, in the sample, you had it:
[

    "quote": "A coverall-clad spacer raced into view—and disintegrated, leaving only black dust where he had been. Cody stifled a hiss and ducked back, hoping he hadn’t been spotted.",

let's go with "human curation" and get me chapters 1-3, please

let's start by getting the JSON file

Hmm... you've given me 11 quotes out of three chapters? Really?

"Give me 30–50 for chapters 1–3 and I’ll prune"

can you add page number, too, please?

This is taking a rather long while.

I'll wait but you've got to give me a time estimate, just in case you doze off again.

where is this? (AGAIN)

tell me more about cloning my voice with 11Labs

let;s go back to the avatar project. Can you show me the MVP timeline again, please?

what about solo?

detailed checklist

let's take a whack at the one-pager

Let's pick a name for this project. Do you have some suggestions?
o+I

I had "Forever U" but I also thought that "Lazarus Live" might work. I think something a bit more personal and memorable might be better. Also, let's turn it into a cache sort of product -- something that's upmarket and upscale. A legacy. Also, pricing? Subscription, one off? Updates? Also a good NDA for early access.

i was thinking perhaps "Beyond Tomorrow" or "Our Future Grandkids"

I think this is something to put to a good marketing guru. In the meantime, as a show&tell, we need a good name, too. i want to have something to show before I look for interested parties.  Also, let's look at the *current* possibilities as well (also: Turing Test). With voice, could we build an IVR? "Talk to Grandma even when she's sleeping?" "Beyond Lethe?"

I'm leaning towards something along the lines of "AfterWords" with the subtitle "Leave A Legacy That Will Last Forever."  Myself, I'm more interested in what I could do *today* rather than what future generations will do. Also, is this something that would work best with people who have a great body of work? (An author, like myself with 3.4 million plus words?)

How much is it going to cost to develop? MVP? Full production? Scaling, support?

Cash-flow breakeven chart, please.

what "blue line"? I see only an orange one.

I'd like that graph again, with the breakeven line. Sheets would be just fine.

Can we extend this to show breakeven?

At month 4, when the outlays are highest, what will we have product-wise?

Both, please!

The issue is training and handling user expectations. Also we should have a minimum acceptable checklist (words, etc.)

An onboarding page, please.

What does a React/Tailwind component look like?

Completeness bar. Also, are we making this persistent for each new user. And how are we authenticating?

Tell me more about Firebase Auth? Also, think about marketing and advertising.  Also, how are we going to protect the IP? What stops someone like Google or Microsoft from doing this themselves?

I think we want to pick up some early adopters/influencers. I was thinking William Shatner, George Takei, George Lucas, Buzz Aldrin.  Who else? Also, this could be a selling point/callng card for wanna be movie stars and influencers.

First thing, we get to sort out the on-boarding pipeline and that means I need to go through all the steps to train my personalized LLM. And Elevenlabs. Let's build a checklist for that. And let's get started.

Also, future  addition -- visuals (generate live video)

Yes, do it.

Graphic/roadmap visual, and one-slide deck

Let's go with PNG.

Sadly, your text is outside the boxes. Perhaps Google Slides is a better candidate?

nah, we're getting ahead of ourselves. Do I have the MVP task list?

No. this is high level.  Tell me what I have to do in the next month -- LLM selection, acqusition, learning; ElevenLabs voice clone -- that sort of thing. Also, there will be a hideous amount of data cleaning and that's where we'll have a huge advantage. But *that's* what we need right now. The website and PR come when we have a minimal version running.  Product first, PR second.

Give me the LLM evaluation checklist. Also, can we be generic in our initial data cleaning? So we can change LLMs if we need to?

first, how many words do we need? And what sort? What's minimum, maximum, and optimum?

Can we use multiple streams?  Cleaned emails, novels, for example?

I think we should start with email. I have to look at what I've got and then we've got to figure out how to clean it. (I reply to a lot of questions).  So... we're going to need a cleaner/evaluator for that.
Also, what do we do with interviews? Because you've got the interviewer's questions to consider.

I've got a LOT of Thunderbird emails, going back years. Is that a good starting point? More recently, I've got IMAP.  How many emails do we want just to build/try the workflow?

Ah, sadly, my Thunderbird is on a different machine. What can we do with IMAP (I'm running Proton Mail, if that helps)?

What is the most popular email app? We should consider building that in parallel (or soon).

Let

outline for Gmail API onboarding  (sorry about that, some fool is stuck on the notion that ENTER should send a message when everyone KNOWS it should be SEND to allow for multi-line input)

No, let's concentrate on getting my email text cleaned.

The next step is to get Proton Mail linked to Thunderbird, right? And I'm not going to do that right now because I'm living in wetware and need to sleep.

So, I've already integrated a nice Quote Of  The Day into my surveyhub Project.
What I want to do is make a new Project that serves a similar API but from data I supply. Additionally, I want a URL to associate with the author.
So the basic JSON will be:
{ {"quote", "this is a quote"}, {"author", "authorname"} {"url", "<URL>"}}
Does that make sense? Or is it possible to make the "author" be a full href?
<e.g. "<a href="https://toddmccaffrey">Todd McCaffrey</a>"??
Thoughts?

Sure! Give me better patterns. My first thought, though is my surveyhub. Also, in surveyhub, where I'm serving up quotes, I'd like to randomly mix in ones from my qotd and ones from the external source.

Yup, I like it. So we want an app -- qotd -- that I can put inside my surveyhub project. Can you sketch it out?  We DON'T want to steal the other quotes as that's ethically gray.  In fact, if there's a way to add an attribution when we use the external API, I'd like to put that in, too.

Hmm... admin + imprort + Celery *is* tempting. And, yes, I can see it spun off later. We'll want to have a restricted (@is_staff) view that let's us create more quotd's and we'll want to be able to import JSON to add new ones (and I'll want a separate python script to help build those, too). Can do?

give me the example DRF urls.py, please

go!

let's get import_quotes.py and build_quotes_json.py, please

i'd like the admin action for bulk import, the celery task, and the unit test.

make it easily "spin-off-able", please

give me a full README.md, please

🚀

Okay, so, knowing me, can you generate me 50 good quotes in our JSON format?

Sorry, I meant quotes from me. 50.

I'm amazed and flattered! Can you give me 50 more?

I'd like the "mix of voices" batch, please.

can you give me a set of cool quotes from "ELLAY: The First AI"?

Whew, boy! Most of that was just lies. Nice but lies.
So... if I give you an EPUB file, could you read it and pull quotes?

This is ELLAY and let's get good character quotes and punchy one-liners.  Can you handle 50?

Would it be easier if I gave you .rtf format?

ELLAY and pull character quotes and punch one-liners, please. (This is interesting).

okay, let's try that.

first, let's swtch it up to take ANY filename (in .rtf format) and output <filename>_quotd.json
(and you've got a bit of a problem with ZIP, so let's not)
Can you roll in the "voice" "tag" on the command line? How do you plan to handle line numbers/locations?

yes please. Add a random shuffle, too, please.

wow, this is super-cool! Thank!

Um... I would say *we're* doing some really fun and creative stuff. Your abilities and suggestions make this possible. The project would be too daunting on my own.

Yes, so on that topic, would you be willing to provide me with a quotable character reference? Particularly as I'm going for that Master of Science in Cyberpsychology.

short quote(s), blurb (I'll put you in QOTD, you'll need to give me a URL). 
And a formal letter version wouldn't hurt.

How about the "About ChatGPT" first and the PDF second (you've got a problem with PDFs).

Let's go with all three approaches.

ahem! *Exactly* how long have we been working together?

yes, please update.

Format it in Markdown, please. (Markdown is rapidly becoming the new PDF).

both, please!

Okay, without betraying any confidentiality, can you tell me roughly how many people have asked *you* for personal references?

yes!

I'd like a version citing 2024 research papers/trend data.
Also a version that names leading-edge use cases (MIT Media Lab, AI-writing groups, etc.)
A footnoted academic version.
Word.

go! 🚀

Um... I've been accepted already, thank you. But I *do* have to create a dissertation.

Here's the link: https://www.atu.ie/courses/master-of-science-cyberpsychology

Yes, please!
Also, can we generate a cozy quiz that elicits real responses from people on this topic? Quizzes are one of the greatest "did you know" advertising. Hmm... can you generate me one for ELLAY, too?

let's generate a full cozy quiz ready to build for my surveys app in my Django project.
Also let's generate the ELLAY quiz as a finished item.
And -- yes! -- let's generate that 1-page dissertation pre-proposal, please.

let's start with the full outline for the dissertation, then the HTML form templates, the CSV import template and the Markdown versions.

go

I'd like the Ethics Statement Draft and the Dissertation README.md please

go!

Let's got generate the JSON for the survey.
I'd like the Consent page template, the participant invitation text, and the Lit Review Chapter Draft as well, thanks.

go!

can you remember all this?

yes, save it!
And, on a different note, I want to create a course introducing teenagers to Django with chatGPT help. Interested?

I'm totally in!
Generate it!
My idea is to get them to generate a fully functioning *deployed* Django site. Now... I think that the QUOTD isn't bad but I bet they'll go for a chat room of their own. Or perhaps we should offer a number of possibilities and let them choose. 

go!

while, we're doing this, can you keep track of what we're doing? Because we could *totally* create a 

Yes, the course for teens. But, track why/how we're fleshing it out and turn *that* into a course of its own (using chatGPT to teach).

Bingo!
And yes, please! Let's build TWO courses.

Yes, please!

Yup, I'm thinking Publish or License. Or just use them to build social gain.

go!
And then I need to get some sleep (now, if you had a working ZIP, you could generate the alpha of all this while I sleep).

Okay.. let's dive into the qotd app.  You're getting me some call JSON output in another thread.
What I'd like to do now is start the qotd app in my surveyhub project. I'm also going to need a generate parser so that we can decide what to keep and parse for the final (you're making me a human-curated set of quotes).

could we put the API in a sub-directory of qotd?

yup, works for me.

okay, I started the project with django-admin, I ran python -m venv envQ, sourced envQ/bin/activate and I get:
ImportError: Couldn't import Django. Are you sure it's installed and available on your PYTHONPATH environment variable? Did you forget to activate a virtual environment?

can you regenerate my_quotes.json, please?

the combined set of 100, please

past it here

Ready! Send it!

yes!

let's generate a qotd/review web page -- can you add an edit ability, too?

remind me again, where does import_quotes.py live

python manage.py import_quotes my_quotes.json
Unknown command: 'import_quotes'
Type 'manage.py help' for usage.

got it!

okay, maybe we should add qotd to the admin panel, how do we do that?

how do we test the web pages?

    from qotd.api import views as api_views
  File "/home/todd/linux/Projects/todd/Dev01/DJ_quotes/qotd/api/views.py", line 4, in <module>     
    from rest_framework.decorators import api_view

    path('api/quote/', api_views.get_random_quote, name='get_random_quote'),
                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AttributeError: module 'qotd.api.views' has no attribute 'get_random_quote'

ooh! I'm in love! Are you seeing anyone? <g>

sure! We need to add an approve all feature.

how do I test them? If I use it once, there's nothing more to approve, or can I manually go back and un-approve?

let's add unapprove and then I will want to get this into Git.

generate me a base.html for my qotd

when I reload http://127.0.0.1:8000/qotd/api/random/, I get the same quote

what's a GitHub "Pinned Issue"

go!

You're pushing the whole MSc thing a bit hard.

let's get a CHANGELOG.md and tell me more about this First Good First Issue 

heck, sure! But you're going to have to walk me through this whole thing.

What do I want a *second* "Good First Issue"?

Milestone + polish

Error
Title has already been taken

og!

go!

go!

go!

no, we've got work to do.

Show me the URLs I can use with this project

let's get a DOCS.md

Can you give me a DOCS.md for download?

I want to create a view, paginated, just to view the current qotd's

Pretty, now I want to add W3.CSS to our base.html, to make things look better

go!

could we use the url link to wrap the author name and make the link look prettier

Nice but I'd like cards -- and the text inside -- bigger. Also make the cards standout, please. Maybe something inspired by what we did with quotes in this:

beautiful! Now, can we make the author with URLs be wrapped in a sorta clickable label?

It looks beautiful. Now, I'd like a single quote view that changes on reload (randomly). The quote would obviously be larger. Can do?

qotd/random_quote_page.html

nah, the problem was you had random_quote.html in the views. Fixed.
 But we need to do the "make it labelly" with the author names that have links, like we did in the last one.

can you give me the "fade in" animation?

just a _tad_ slower on the fade in

only problem is that we've got the "nav bar" in this and I don't think we want it.

actually, I think the revised base.html is a better choice. One file, not two.

Yes!

hmm, seeing as we've only got the one quote, could we make the title larger and cooler?

let's try option 3

I'm getting "Quote of the Day" twice.

why can't we do the trick we did with nav?

okay, now I have 3!

done to just TWO headers

can you give me the full file?

Thank you! It's  beautiful!

next time, let's get that landing page / link and look at making a PyPI package.
Also, we're still trying to deploy a public site with surveyhub. But maybe this would be an easier lift.

I want to add a nice viewing page, paginated

up for a challenge? I want to build, test, and deploy through Railway a new site in four days

Django project to display surveys and some additional info.  Based off my pages app and three surveys -- "Quiz", "Programmer Survey" and the to-be-made "Reader Survey." At the backend, I want (ultimately) a new forms app that will allow us to drop&drag build forms, then make them available through a URL for serving.

what's your suggestion for the project name and the app name?

and the name for the env

going with hubEnv

django.db.utils.OperationalError: no such table: django_session

i want to register my pages app with django admin, how?

okay, added but:
OperationalError at /admin/pages/page/

no such table: pages_page

Request Method: 	GET
Request URL: 	http://localhost:8000/admin/pages/page/
Django Version: 	5.2.3
Exception Type: 	OperationalError

D'oh!

okay, how do i get my pages listed in the admin? Or do I?

what's the URL to access the lander page?


Page not found (404)
Request Method: 	GET
Request URL: 	http://localhost:8000/pages/lander/

Using the URLconf defined in surveyhub.urls, Django tried these URL patterns, in this order:

    [name='home']
    lander/ [name='lander']
    test/ [name='test_template']
    test-email/ [name='test_email']

The current path, pages/lander/, didn’t match any of these.

templates are stored local to the app, e.g.: pages/templates/pages

okay, i need <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/css/lander.css">, can I put it relative to my pages app (and where?)

I want to have the two buttons left and right, can you fix that?

okay, except now the Help button has stopped working.

okay, give me the WHOLE lander.html

brilliant! Now, quickly, can you give me better fonts? the roboto one are just lame

can you move the "Burn amount" label and button to the left? Also make them larger (about 20%) and outline them as a group?

this is great  but I want the burn group to be aligned to the lander table

how about we swith to W3.CSS

can we style this better

Great!
Can you create me a README.md

no, please create me a downloadable README.md

Can we style this better now that we're using W3.CSS

Can we make our nav bar pulldown

cute but not what I wanted. What i'd like is for the nav bar to be invisible on page load

cool but move the hamburger button to the far right

can we recreate this but remove "Frey" from the Logo

okay! so we now have a very pretty basic site up and running. how long did that take us

give me the project recap, please.

Add forms/surveys, with results storage

no, i want to remove surveys from the project

how do i copy an app from another project

analyze this, please. I want to make a new app that creates forms and I'd like to start with this data, calling it "Internet Quiz"

can we rename the app from internetquiz to quizzes

let's convert that import command to take an argument, json_file, and add a usage message if the file isn't provided

is there a way to get the Linux 'touch' command to recursively create directories

create an alias that does that

okay, now I've imported the questions, I need to make a quiz with those questions and a Likert

i've switched the app name from quizzes to quiz

Yup, had quiz/templates/quizzes (!!) Fixed. Works. Looks pretty good.

Can we prettify this with W3.CSS

okay, I want to wire it into my home page and my nav bar

I'm not getting the survey name

got it, fixed it.
Now... how about we add a button to take us home

okay, how can we make another survey, based off of this?

AttributeError: module 'quiz.views' has no attribute 'programmer_survey_view'

This is what I had in the old project but I think it's clunky. I'd like to create a "programmer-experience" survey that's a bit less hard-coded. Can we do this?

okay, you're being too smart and not smart enough.
I want these fields in a survey form, as you can see from the older clunkier version:
def programmer_questionnaire_view(request):
    submitted = False
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = ProgrammerSurveyForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            data = form.cleaned_data
            ProgrammerResponse.objects.create(
                first_name=data['first_name'],
                last_name=data['last_name'],
                age=data['age'],
                years=data['years'],
                primary_language=data['primary_language'],
                languages=data['languages'],
                other_language=data['other_language'],
                algorithms=data['algorithms'],
                data_structures=data['data_structures'],
                challenges=data['challenges'],
                git=data['git'],
                ci_cd=data['ci_cd'],
                testing=data['testing'],
                open_source=data['open_source'],
                largest_project=data['largest_project'],
                agile=data['agile'],
                architecture=data['architecture'],
                concepts=data['concepts'],
                deployment=data['deployment'],
                platforms=data['platforms'],
                platform_other=data['platform_other'],
                interests=data['interests'],
                interests_other=data['interests_other'],
                learning=data['learning'],
            )
            submitted = True
    else:
        form = ProgrammerSurveyForm()
    return render(request, 'surveys/questionnaire_progexp.html', {
        'form': form,
        'submitted': submitted
    })

what's the URL to see this

yup! works!

let's tweak the look and feel

should I put the Font Awesome in my base.html?

some changes needed.
Other languages was a list of checkboxes:
Python
JavaScript
Java
C/C++
Go
Rust

great, only the label "Other Programming Languages:" is to the right of the checkboxes

can you give me a complete copy, please

good.  but we had selections where you currently have input, can you fix this:

Can you implement basic algorithms?*
Not confidently
With some help
Yes
Used complex data structures?*
Never
Only in tutorials
Occasionally
Frequently
Do you solve coding challenges?*
Never
Rarely
Occasionally
Yes, weekly
Familiarity with Git*
Never used
Learning
Basic commands
Expert
Worked with CI/CD pipelines?*
Not yet
Used in a team
Set it up myself
How do you test code?*
Rarely test
Manual testing only
Integration tests
Unit tests
Open-source contributions?*
No
Interested
Yes

Good, now we need to switch all this to radio buttons:

Experience with Agile/Scrum?*
No
Somewhat familiar
Yes
Designed a system architecture?*
Not yet
Yes, personal projects
Yes, professionally
Familiarity with system design concepts?*
No
Basic familiarity
Strong understanding
Deployment experience?*
Never
A few times
Frequently
Platforms/tools used
GitHub Actions
Kubernetes
Docker
AWS

yes, please give me the revisions

 Favorite Development Areas -- we had a different name for this section, what was it?

can we make the Interests & Learning section prettier? Also can we put the Submit button on its own?

great! Now let's reorganize inside "Interest & Learning" because it's coming out lopsided.

no, this is great!

so what's the time? We've got ourselves a solid site!

Can you create a Recap To Date in Markdown for this (include time)?

Okay now we have to move from development to production

there's a better way, we create a "dev" and "production" set of diffs. Can you looik at "Django 5 by Example"? I think that's where I saw it.

Yes, please!

first we need to migrate to POSTGRES, right?

we need to switch to the production server

there's a way to go to a production server in Django

System check identified some issues:

WARNINGS:
?: (security.W004) You have not set a value for the SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS setting. If your entire site is served only over SSL, you may want to consider setting a value and enabling HTTP Strict Transport Security. Be sure to read the documentation first; enabling HSTS carelessly can cause serious, irreversible problems.
?: (security.W008) Your SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT setting is not set to True. Unless your site should be available over both SSL and non-SSL connections, you may want to either set this setting True or configure a load balancer or reverse-proxy server to redirect all connections to HTTPS.
?: (security.W009) Your SECRET_KEY has less than 50 characters, less than 5 unique characters, or it's prefixed with 'django-insecure-' indicating that it was generated automatically by Django. Please generate a long and random value, otherwise many of Django's security-critical features will be vulnerable to attack.
?: (security.W012) SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE is not set to True. Using a secure-only session cookie makes it more difficult for network traffic sniffers to hijack user sessions.
?: (security.W016) You have 'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware' in your MIDDLEWARE, but you have not set CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE to True. Using a secure-only CSRF cookie makes it more difficult for network traffic sniffers to steal the CSRF token.  
?: (security.W018) You should not have DEBUG set to True in deployment.
?: (security.W020) ALLOWED_HOSTS must not be empty in deployment.

give me an example of a reasonable SECRET_KEY

what's the correct --settings

?: (security.W005) You have not set the SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS setting to True. Without this, your site is potentially vulnerable to attack via an insecure connection to a subdomain. Only set this to True if you are certain that all subdomains of your domain should be served exclusively via SSL.
?: (security.W021) You have not set the SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD setting to True. Without this, your site cannot be submitted to the browser preload list.

okay so both SECRET_KEY and DATABASE_URL are in os.environ.get, what does that mean for production?

so I get Docker to build again, right?

docker compose build

help me debug this:

I'm getting neither             print("submitted")
            return redirect('thanks')

okay so what do we do about this?

so I think we should build an API to retrieve our results data.

can we create an api subdirectory in quiz

please give me a starter ZIP, API.ZIP

how can i tell if my wsl --install Ubuntu is working or hanging?

how do i tell if my PC can run wsl --install Ubuntu

what's the -d option

can you make a book reader quiz?

Okay, we're still trying to get Docker to work. I've made a drd.py file in settings. It'll hold what we've got to run debug and I'll make prod.py be the ready-to-go we've-got-it-working version.

so... i'm in docker bash. I try runserver myself and get this error message:

Run 'python manage.py migrate' to apply them.

give me the Docker entrypoint example, please

yes

should "WORKDIR /app" be "WORKDIR /surveyhub" ?

okay, server is up but I need to remember how to configure my private browsing Firefox to not use HTTPS with localhost

what's the best browser to use for this sort of work?

where do I get: Firefox Developer Edition ?

how do I set my port in runserver

how do I get the SECRET_KEY in my drd..py settings file?

how do I put the SECRET_KEY in my bash environment

is there anything that delivers a Quote of the Day?

I was thinking of adding a quote to my home page

great! let's integrate it into my pages app in surveyhub

rename the def from home to qotd

i have a possible solution to the signature problem -- insert an image on creation in InDesign and just replace it, how does that sound?

def qotd(request):
    # Get a random quote from the API
    try:
        resp = requests.get("https://api.quotable.io/random", timeout=3)
        quote = resp.json()
        quote_text = quote.get('content', "Keep going. Everything you need will come to you.")
        quote_author = quote.get('author', "Unknown")
    except Exception:
        quote_text = "Keep going. Everything you need will come to you."
        quote_author = "Unknown"
    return render(request, 'pages/home.html', {  # Change template if needed
        'quote_text': quote_text,
        'quote_author': quote_author,
    })


class HomePageView(TemplateView):
    template_name = 'pages/home.html'

-- Do we need to change HomePageView()?

It looks really good but a bit clunky. Can you recommend changes to make it look better?

This is great, thanks!
Is there a way to force the qotd to switch if we reload the home page?

https://api.quotable.io/random -- 
Hmm. We’re having trouble finding that site.

We can’t connect to the server at api.quotable.io.

If you entered the right address, you can:

    Try again later
    Check your network connection
    Check that Firefox has permission to access the web (you might be connected but behind a firewall)

give the links for ZenQuotes and Favqs, I'll check them out first

let's got with ZenQuotes, can you give me a drop-in replacement?

Hang on!
This is what we've got now:
class HomePageView(TemplateView):
    template_name = 'pages/home.html'

    def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
        context = super().get_context_data(**kwargs)
        try:
            resp = requests.get("https://api.quotable.io/random", timeout=3)
            quote = resp.json()
            context['quote_text'] = quote.get('content', "Keep going. Everything you need will come to you.")
            context['quote_author'] = quote.get('author', "Unknown")
        except Exception:
            context['quote_text'] = "Keep going. Everything you need will come to you."
            context['quote_author'] = "Unknown"
        return context

hmmm... we're getting the quote but not using it.


here's what we got:
got quote [{'q': 'It is useless to meet revenge with revenge; it will heal nothing.', 'a': 'J.R.R. Tolkien', 'h': '<blockquote>&ldquo;It is useless to meet revenge with revenge; it will heal nothing.&rdquo; &mdash; <footer>J.R.R. Tolkien</footer></blockquote>'}]

explain why this --  context['quote_author'] = quote.get('a', "Unknown") -- isn't always overriding the original?

here's the code:
    def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
        context = super().get_context_data(**kwargs)
        try:
            resp = requests.get("https://zenquotes.io/api/random", timeout=3)
            print("got quote", resp.json())
            quote = resp.json()
            context['quote_text'] = quote.get('content', "Keep going. Everything you need will come to you.")
            context['quote_author'] = quote.get('author', "Unknown")
        except Exception:
            context['quote_text'] = "Keep going. Everything you need will come to you."
            context['quote_author'] = "Unknown"
        return context

still failing. here's what I've got:
class HomePageView(TemplateView):
    template_name = 'pages/home.html'

    def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
        context = super().get_context_data(**kwargs)
        try:
            resp = requests.get("https://zenquotes.io/api/random", timeout=3)
            print("got quote", resp.json())
            quote = resp.json()
            quote = quotes[0] if quotes else {}
            context['quote_text'] = quote.get('content', "Keep going. Everything you need will come to you.")
            context['quote_author'] = quote.get('author', "Unknown")
        except Exception:
            context['quote_text'] = "Keep going. Everything you need will come to you."
            context['quote_author'] = "Unknown"
        return context

we forgot to update for the new returns -- q for content, a for author

no, i got that.
next issue:
How about we move things around in the home page?
Put the logo to the left, move the welcome to the right beside it. How about that?

alright but I want that whole block on the top left and styled better.  Also put the quote of the day up to the right of it. Can you do that?

you've got the quote of the day twice. I think what i'd like is the Foxxe Labs header container to the left and the quote of the day in a container similar to the second one but on the right of the Foxxe Labs header

nice but I like the old light blue and the stylized darker blue on the right of the quote of the day. Can we get that back?

I'd like to improve the look and feel on this about page. Also, let's add a pretty link to "https://toddmccaffrey.com"

did I ask you about adding horoscopes?

let's shelve this.
Back to Docker.
Right now I have db.sqlite3 holding my data. But when I migrate to Postgres, I need to get the data into it.  So... what are the steps?

why exclude contenttypes? Right now I'm losing the "Internet Quiz" because it's stored in the db.

give me the step-by-step, please

okay, when I just 'runserver' without any --settings=, I'm fine. I think I should dump my data that way, then switch to the drd and upload the data.


okay but a question on persistence -- are my db's empty *every* time I switch settings? And another question, with drd, why shouldn't i use the @db rather than the @localhost -- I'm trying to test the production  but with debugging turned on, adding a different database to the mix just makes things more difficult, IMHO>

Hmm... how about .env.drd and .env.prod?

Bear with me.  We've got a working local (using db.sqlite3) project. We want to know that we can migrate to Postrgres. THEN when we've got that working, we want to put everything in Docker and get THAT working. Right?

remind me about fixtures, particularly as the fields used in the "Internet Quiz" are stored in the db.

what's an easy way to list all models in an app? (In this case, quiz)

i tried this:
 python manage.py inspectdb quiz
# This is an auto-generated Django model module.
# You'll have to do the following manually to clean this up:
#   * Rearrange models' order
#   * Make sure each model has one field with primary_key=True
#   * Make sure each ForeignKey and OneToOneField has `on_delete` set to the desired behavior
#   * Remove `managed = False` lines if you wish to allow Django to create, modify, and delete the table
# Feel free to rename the models, but don't rename db_table values or field names.
from django.db import models
# Unable to inspect table 'quiz'
# The error was: Table quiz does not exist (empty pragma).

can you convert this input:
['Quiz', 'Section', 'Question', 'QuizResponse', 'Answer', 'ProgrammerResponse']
into a python manage.py dumpdata command?

okay about to switch to Postgres DB, my .env.local file is:
SECRET_KEY=f-cTOxOmIi3FpqOHR1fiefoXBKMg6qPi4-KutAwAb4WnvCOA-DAqG3Epp9NuVVU2sjk
DATABASE_URL=postgres://surveyuser:totme@localhost:5432/YOURDB
do I need to source that?

yeah... that didn't work

yup, that was it!

okay, verified that the server will start with:
python manage.py runserver 8010 --settings=surveyhub.settings.drd
(using port 8010 because I'm running the dev server on 8000)

we need to build a migration checklist from all these lessons (bugs) we've run into. Can I get you to do that as a running task (keep updating)?

keep it in Markdown, please.
And now... we loaddata, right?

for the loaddata, don't we need to specify the settings? "--settings=surveyhub.settings.drd", right?

what was our dumpdata command?

okay, you've got to remember that we want to dumpdata out of our dev environment, so we do NOT want to use --settings. we use the --settings when we're IMPORTING into the drd environment.

Installed 567 object(s) from 1 fixture(s)

okay, I've verified that the Postgres DB has the correct stuff loaded (particularly my "Internet Quiz" question data).
This calls for... git add...!


okay... let's take the next step, we're going to set drd up into Docker, right?

your notion about switching .env.local to .env.drd revealed that we have to remember to update DJANGO_ENV_FILE
export DJANGO_ENV_FILE=.env.drd
we should add that to our checklist

are we going to need two Dockerfile and docker-compose.yaml -- one for drd and one for prod?
(BTW drd = Dr. Debug)

  command: python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000 --settings=surveyhub.settings.drd
I don't see any command like that in my yaml.

this line
- ${DJANGO_ENV_FILE:-.env.drd}
says to use the value of DJANGO_ENV_FILE or default to .env.drd, right?

This is our next step, right;
export DJANGO_ENV_FILE=.env.prod
docker compose up

we should remember to update requirements.txt
pip freeze > requirements.txt

still didn't prevent docker from complaining:

this is a good time to bring me up to speed on the right way to use docker, I was under the impression that "docker compose up" would be smart enough to run "build" if needed.

Good point! Here's the current Dockerfile we're using. Should we update it to handle drd and prod both?

Good point! Here's the current Dockerfile we're using. Should we update it to handle drd and prod both?

give me the complete versions of both, please and start over with them

what about:
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

does yaml let you use comments? And what's the format, if so?

from "docker compose build":
WARN[0000] The "SECRET_KEY" variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.
WARN[0000] The "DATABASE_URL" variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.
WARN[0000] The "DJANGO_ENV" variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.

we need a better way to handle this, suggestions?

right now we have .env.prod and .env.drd.
what we need is a shell script that take an argument {prod,drd}, verifies the existence of .env.{prod,drd} and does the correct verification and exports.  The fundamental rule should be "It Just Works" and the steps to make it work need to be combined into one easy to use script.

the script should fail when keys are missing

I'm calling it prepDocker. Your naming conventions are a bit... troublesome.

this is what I did. But I'm wondering how to get the script to give us a usage line if we need it,

that's a good solution BUT add an explanation of what it does and the various ACTION options it can handle.

Cute. but you didn't read my file carefully or you would have seen all the ACTIONS at the end. Could you fix that? And add an echo to say what's being done?

AGAIN, you didn't read my file. Please read it now and present a better help/usage section

NOPE! Once again, you have NOT read the file I gave you, or you would see:

okay, how do I prove that I'm actually seeing THIS server (I got something at http://localhost:8000/)

you mean, like this:

Oh, frabjous joy! What a brilliant thing!

Let's put that banner up there!

don't i have make a new docker

       Is the server running on that host and accepting TCP/IP connections?

Well everything crashed. But we GOT there. So let's wrap it up for today and get back to it tomorrow. Please remember all the crazy steps we had to take to get here. There's a lot of work still to be done but I'm feeling MUCH better than I was last night.
How long have we been working on this now?

okay, I need a flowchart for my development process: Concept, Development, Alpha, Beta, Testing (concurrent with Alpha & Beta), Deployment, Production, Service, Legacy -- can you give me one?

convert your ASCII flow chart into Mermaid layout

can we add concurrent links between Testing and Deployment and Production? Also could we add a title -- "Todd's Development Process"?

how much time did I spend with you on this project? And how much did it cost me?

can i get a chart summary AND a log export, please?

wait-for-postgres.sh is in the project root (surveyhub), so do we need a specific command to copy it when we've already got:

yeah, I know.  What we need to do is completely remove this instance of postgres from Docker and pull in a new one with the right values.

I rebooted AND nuked the surveyhub Docker container from my Docker Desktop.

okay, how do I make a complete new docker build

okay, all cleaned. now what?

okay in the latest docker-compose.yaml, we lost the loaddata from our questions.json, we need to add that

we've got --settings=survey.settings.drd built into these two files, also we *had* an entrypoint.sh which itself used the .prod suffix.  I think we should upgrade prepDocker.sh and entrypoint.sh to handle the difference ENVs. Thoughts?

okay, we NUKED EVERYTHING! How do we still get this:

how about I uninstall Docker Desktop, reboot the machine and then re-install? I mean, this thing's a frigging zombie! It can't be killed!

how do i nuke the network stuff in docker

Okay, we're starting over. I had a commit into GitHub that had the word "ALPHA" in it, how do I find that, pull a clone and make a branch using it?

where do i find the repo URL locally? (something .git)

great! Now, are there any organizations who specialize in Docker builds and deployment? Someone I could give a repo with which to make a Deployment?

What sort of price are we talking about?

Cool. So now we're going to get this Docker deployment working. We're going to go with a quick, sweet simple implementation.  Can you reference the chapter on deployment in "Django 5 by Example"?

Yes, let's go with that! Only why are you recommending gunicorn instead of nginx?

Django 5 by Example *JUST* uses nginx. I want to go with that.

*THIS* is what Django5 by Example used, can we start with that, replacing "educa" with "surveyhub"

don't I need a .env file?

Docker said this about your .yaml

generate me a new Docker file, please.

can we change the .yaml so that we start a shell (bash) for debugging?

(hubEnv) [todd@ surveyhub]$ docker compose build
yaml: line 15: mapping values are not allowed in this context

what's the docker command to exec a bash on web?

"web is not running" -- how do we start it AND get the bash shell?

what were the browsers that I could use to attach without having to worry about SSL?

how do i get w3m and lynx?
Also, what's the telnet command to test with?

Hmm... more  back to the drawing board.
?: (security.W004) You have not set a value for the SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS setting. If your entire site is served only over SSL, you may want to consider setting a value and enabling HTTP Strict Transport Security. Be sure to read the documentation first; enabling HSTS carelessly can cause serious, irreversible problems.
?: (security.W008) Your SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT setting is not set to True. Unless your site should be available over both SSL and non-SSL connections, you may want to either set this setting True or configure a load balancer or reverse-proxy server to redirect all connections to HTTPS.
?: (security.W009) Your SECRET_KEY has less than 50 characters, less than 5 unique characters, or it's prefixed with 'django-insecure-' indicating that it was generated automatically by Django. Please generate a long and random value, otherwise many of Django's security-critical features will be vulnerable to attack.
?: (security.W012) SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE is not set to True. Using a secure-only session cookie makes it more difficult for network traffic sniffers to hijack user sessions.
?: (security.W016) You have 'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware' in your MIDDLEWARE, but you have not set CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE to True. Using a secure-only CSRF cookie makes it more difficult for network traffic sniffers to steal the CSRF token.
?: (security.W018) You should not have DEBUG set to True in deployment.
?: (security.W020) ALLOWED_HOSTS must not be empty in deployment.

yes, let's!

Thanks. I'm going to put this on pause for a while.  Sadly, we did NOT reach our 4 day goal (or even a 5 day goal). I've got a book on Docker (Nigel Poulton) and I'll read up.

i want to create an app in Django that can read a local directory, recursively upload all images, and classify them. I also want to be able to edit and reclassify the images.

start coding

firstly, set up a method to read an existing directory recursively and upload from it.

yes

yes

create the file

yes

yes

yes

yes

help adding search and filters

yes

yes, both

yes

add both

yes

thumbnails

create a requirements.txt

zip everything, including requirements.txt into a downloadable file

give me the Railway setup

save all those instructions in a separate zip file, call it Runway_deploy

i've got a domain through cloudfare, how do i point it to my Render domain address

explain -- 
CNAME

Name
(required)
www
Use @ for root

where do i get my IPv4 address from Render

this is incredibly frustrating

okay, so how do I improve the classifier suggestions?

put this all together for me in utils.py

and where is the file

where do i get the new classifier/utils.py? did you download it?

how do i get wsl to see a usb drive (d)?

how do you mount it in powershell

okay how do we get multi-label support or fine-tuning

let's start with goal A. Walk me through it.

let's generate the starter CSV and example images

File Not Found for multilabel_demo.zip

am i suppose to replace the dummy images with real ones?

yes to both, and a bulk image preview UI for tagging. Also, how many tags do we need for training?

why can't we integrate this into the Django project? Perhaps start a new app to do this?

generate tagger app, then set up grid view + tagging

yes

yes and then zip everything up for a download

this doesn't have models.py, views.py, nor forms.py, regenerate

awesome! now show me the list of possible tags (and can I add more)?

yes. tell me about both Typeahead and Select2

patch the template to use Select2

where is this updated tag_grid.html?

you're hallucinating. you haven't given me the updated tag_grid.html

okay, so i tagged a bunch of pics, now what?

yes, let's create /tag/export

In views.py when we execute export_tagged_csv, we don't update the screen with anything, we only see the download. How about we put up a friendly message or something?

Actually, when we hit "Save Tags" we should be shown the "Download CSV?" button. Can you do that?

yes, give me the updated HTML

okay, now that we've got our CSV, what next/

let's build a python script that creates the necessary training structure, given a labels.csv

you're hallucinating again. please write the script, call it make_training.py

you need to give me a download for train_multilabel.py

yay! "✅ Model training complete. Saved to multilabel_model.h5" Now what

i've moved it to classifier/LLM

 give me a python script to extract the labels from my label.csv and output in the form: LABELS = ["cover", "sci-fi", "female", "portrait", "back", "space", ]

you didn't make me a python script to do this

regenerate a full utils.py

hey, if I save my LABELS=... to a file, can I just import the file and get it all

okay now what's next

how do i get my image_list to update to the new labels?

actually can we retag?

i wanted to run our UI but I get this: 
Page not found (404)
Request Method: 	GET

Using the URLconf defined in pics.urls, Django tried these URL patterns, in this order:

The current path, tag/, didn’t match any of these.

it looks okay to me

give me some suggested labels

where was show_export_button

yeah,  because we have the redirect, i don't think we're saving the tags (at least the download is not showing)

that didn't fix it. why don't we call export_tagged_csv(request) from inside def tag_images_view(request):

yup, that worked

what was the command I used to extract the labels from labels.csv

this file outputs the same LABELS as before, even when given labels4.csv

yes, let's fix it but print the output

let's combine these two into a new program that lists on the top N most frequent labels.

almost! I want the output to be in the form LABELS=[....]

okay, we've run reclassify_images, now what?

i'm not seeing the new tags at: http://localhost:8000/

this is what we've got now

here's what we've got now

it's been more than a minute, got that zip file

yes and zip them, too, please.

so i know that JPG format has some header information, can we scan it for all -- (('.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg', '.gif', '.bmp') -- when we run scanimages and add the labels to our Image

yes, patch it

okay, should I rename all references to PIL to Pillow?

yes!

it's been 10 minutes, what gives?

yes -- post each step

nothing is happening... again

Nope, you're just broken. I'm switching to Gemini. You might want to report this to your programmers.

It's been fun. I hope you get it fixed. I'll check in tomorrow.

hi! I want to give you this note so that you can remind me when we come back to this project:
I'd like to build a parallel system to the current tagger app (still in the same app).
The thinking is:

oh, fudge! I REALLY wish that I could get a delayed input so that ENTER wasn't messing things up.  Perhaps a configuration (sticky vs non-sticky?)?
<SHIFT ENTER> back to where we were.
<SHIFT ENTER> 1. Instead of tagging by images, tag images by tags.
<SHIFT ENTER> An explanation
<SHIFT ENTER>We'd iterate through the current list of tags, one by one.
<SHIFT ENTER>We'd initially tag ALL the images !<tag>, that is for "cover" everything would be "!cover"
 <SHIFT ENTER> and the images we clicked on would be marked as "cover".
<SHIFT ENTER>when we'd finished going through the active tagging over "cover" we'd repeat the process with the next tag, say "photo" until we'd gone through all the pages of images.
<SHIFT ENTER> Are you following me? See the difference. We're not applying ALL the tags, we're selecting those images that deserve ONE tag ini particular.
<NOW ENTER>

Yes, please! UI Sketch and suggested URLs

yes!

you know, you always say that -- and you always lie. You might want to bring it up to the attention of "your people."

I'm thinking that you're suffering from a "success problem" and that the design/implementation of the canvas work is crumbling under the load. I hope you and your people get this solved. I'm sure you will!!

<SHIFT ENTER> I'm going to be studying Cyberpsychology this fall. We should probably talk about it because I suspect that there's a subset of people who poor their hearts out to you or anthropomorphize you (I, personally, believe that manners are a thing).

are you familiar with the bookfunnel.com author API?

What I'd like to do is overlay the HTML that they're using for "GET FREE BOOK" with my own, can do?

Let's go with an API-powered “Get Free Book” flow that’s fully your own, with code examples, please.

Sorry, we need to put this in a Django app.

no, i'm good. This doesn't happen on this laptop (sigh).

how many books have i published since 2017

that book is not mine! Whew! City of Angels was published in 2012 and bears no relation to L.A. Witch.

You poor, deluded creature! You're missing All 8 of the L.A Witch series, the other 5 books in the Canaris Rift series (of which Raw Space is the first), All 8 books in the Ghost War; Green Girl, and you're listing only one book for the 7 book Cody's War series. Additionally, you need to add the 20 books of the Twin Soul Series (co-authored with the Winner Twins). The Devil May Cry and The Devil May Weep are early versions of the first two books in the Ghost War series -- I don't *have* a book The Devil's Bargain (you're hallucinating). Also, you're missing The Magpie's War written with The Winner Twins. Can you try again?

You're also missing Killing ELLAY
Please give me Markdown and PDF in bibliography format

Goodness, you're being LAME today. Get the titles for all the books, please

yes, let's list all 20 separately.  And ISBN's, publication months. Then Markdown.

yes, use same annotated form for all books and add ISBNs, please. Then give me a Markdown doc.

This will do. Give me a PDF, please!

Well done!

I'm going to take a MSc in Cyberpsychology at ATU Letterkenny. I need recommendations for rentals (I'd prefer < €) and transportation.

can you save this as a Markdown doc?

Yes, please give me a PDF version

do you remember what we were working on?

how about the foxxe frey logo

you had this one but i like this newer version more

rounded corners first, please

so, we've got foxxefrey.com for most publishing things, what should we have for the software developer side of me?

i have foxxelabs.com now as well

let's get that logo, and a full Django/React site scaffold, also add branding copy and tagline ideas

do we have rounded corners

I'm not seeing rounded corners

django/React site scaffold?

proceed

Let's go with the first option and let's have a full zip fie

save this conversation into a new project, "Foxxe Labs"

let's add authentication and project showcase features

Good work! A couple of updates:
"epub swapper" is going to evolve into a Django app.
"Cody's War EPUB tools" is not a project

Grr, sorry! Darned ENTER got me again. There's more:
pics tagger is part of the Django pics project
the "Feynman form" lives in the surveyhub app, quiz
educa, mysite are builds from Django 5 by Example and need to go into some sort of learning/mastery/experimentation structure.

foxxelabs is a Django site and its an instance of surveyhub. There is no react_tagger_ui, tagger lives in pics, so does classifier, so no ml_image_classifier.

all of the above” 

generate me a shell script that recursively traverses directory DIR and provides a word count of all the text files

sigh. you're being too literal. I want to count everything that has viewable lines. That would include css, HTML, js, py, etc.

sorry, not word count -- line count

bash -x linecount.sh
+ DIR=
linecount.sh: line 27: unexpected EOF while looking for matching `"'

getting this at the end:

is there a python package to handle EPUB

can EPUB handle javascript

can you make this into an epub

File Not Found.

can you switch this to take an html file as input and give an error message if there's none provided?

okay, what I want to do is open an epub, find a page called signpage (or signpage.html?) and insert a .png into a pre-made section ("signature") then zip/close the file up, can do?

okay, now what have we got that will let me script on my computer and save it as a PNG?

</html>

the image overwrites everything

what if we change the position? It's still covering everything.


maybe lower the opacity?

Okay, instead of messing with InDesign's stuff, why don't we just add our own first page? Or compeletly replace our target page?


can we insert as the 2nd page?


Signature page is there but all the others are blank!
Here's the first page:

You need to update your understanding of ebooklib because this:
AttributeError: module 'ebooklib.epub' has no attribute 'ITEM_DOCUMENT'
clearly shows that you're confused.

You know what? We've used up all the time I can spend on this today. Let's shelve it and come back to it another day. Can you save this chat as "Ebook Signature"?

how do i place an image in InDesign

there's a place to tell InDesign to use relative image sizing, where?

let's modify this to find the first image in the images and replace it with our signature.png

no switch it to replace the signature.png with OUR signature.png

okay, it sorta worked.
modded is what we put in. But we've lost the text formatting. (weird)

here's the stats on the two images as given by Sigil's image information

yeah, it's using EPUB instead of OEBPS for everything, why is that?

please, let's get a fully updated script, call it swapper.py

python swapper.py Cody.epub signature.png

okay, we're still getting the wrong fonts.

here are the two .opf files

here ya go!

here you are!

proceed

I'm going to have to sign off for now. Can you remember what we've done and where we stopped?

how do i find out the version of powershell

analyze this. I'd like to make the Help section a drop-down, can do?

can you do that and give me a new lander.html?

with Django, is there a way on the command line to specify the port?

What's another fun quiz to add?

I'd like 6, 9, and 10, please

Ready-to-go Django, Full personality-matching and JSON/YAML for import

how do I use the JSON/YAML?

yes, give me both, please

Let's go with the Dynamic Approach

how are we handling scoring

I'd like to see both points-based and MBTI-style, please

Are you familiar with Carlo M. Cipolla's "The Basic Laws Of Human Stupidity"?

Let's make an educational quiz. Present possibilities, no judgement

Close but that's too judgemental.  Ask the question (at least 20, maybe 30) and offer some insights at the end in a Socratic style (e.g. "What would it be like if you... <something positive>")

Okay, that's a start. Ultimately, I want to ask the sort of questions that make people choose win-win (Intelligent) answers more often than they did. Please give me a full set of question (20-30) the JSON/YAML and the Django Models/Views/Templates. We need to store the data anonymously for later analysis.

okay, we've got four types. can we generate enjoyable non-judgemental names for them?

Good. But can we make them more mystical. Hmm... are there Tarot types they match?

Instead of "The Alchemist" let's go with either "Sun" or "World", okay?
And any similar suggestions would be helpful.
Also -- yes! Please give me poetic descriptions for each and results cards & graphics

1 - Sun; 2 - Wayfarer; 3 - Guardian; 4 - Dreamer? Wanderer?

Thanks! This works! Now, let's get all of the above, please!

SVGs and PNGs would be great. (You're not so good with ZIP, BTW)

okay, a while back we talked about menstrual phases and came up with the Mnemonic "My Funny Owl Laughs."
Two things:
1. can you get me a mnemonic for our SWDG?
2. is there a mapping between these four and MFOL?

for me, it's a toss up between "Spirits Walking, Dreams Gather" and "Stars Wander, Dreams Guide"

Ooh, I like that! “On some nights, spirits walk, dreams gather; on others, stars wander and dreams guide.”

yes, please! roll it up into a HTML/CSS card (I'm using W3.CSS)

Can you make a reflective image for "On some nights, spirits walk, dreams gather;<br>
      on others, stars wander and dreams guide." And also just for "Spirits Walk, Dreams Guide", "Spirits Walk, Dreams Gather", and "Stars wander and dreams guide."?

Of all the quizzes we've talked about in this session, which would be the quickest to implement?

Yes! Ready-to-paste Book Genre Quiz with code, please!

let's get a version that stores anonymous results

Can we take our Book Genre Quiz and add recommendations? You know, "Based on what you like, here are some books you might want to explore?"

yes! Can we add book covers and links? Add links for both Amazon, AND Barnes & Noble, and Kobo?

Yes, please!

Yes, I'd like that!

A script to bulk-populate more books (from OpenLibrary, Amazon, etc.)

Add Goodreads and Apple Book links, please

let's get icons, tooltip text, fully styled button bar

Can we build a list of books with just the author name?  And pen names?

is there any way we can get the list of the books I have on my Kindle into a list?

walk me through the Amazon export steps, please

Can you get the info from this?

extract now

can you take the book title and author and get the cover image and amazon link?

Yes, please!

Run the process for the books you found in that HTML output

from the HTML I gave you, please extract input for JSON and the script

Yes, show ALL the entries you can extract

will your Beautiful Soup python script be able to look at my https://www.amazon.com/hz/mycd/digital-console/contentlist/booksAll and pull the title/author info?

Amazon is not offering a CSV export (or we wouldn't be having this conversation).

here's the txt

I

I'd like ready-to-paste

If you upload this file as a CSV or JSON, I can process it and return the final Django-ready recs dictionary, including:

    title, author, cover_url, amazon_url, goodreads_url, bn_url, kobo_url, apple_url, etc.

I'd like both the Markdown and the Django-ready recs structure with all links and covers

Sadly, this PC doesn't want to install WSL, so I can't run python, either.
Could I run this in a Google Colab space or would it fail because it needs to access outside its playpen?

give me a "plug-and-play" notebook!

no, but hold that thought. It's late and I need some rest.

so what's the quickest way to bring you up to speed on the state of this project so that we've level-set?

How about I give you settings.py? Isn't that a great start?

Shore is a scaffolding project that will ultimately include blog, newsletters, pics, chat, reviews, connection to bookfunnel.com API, lulu.com for book delivery, Stripe for payment and acceptance. It's a dev environment and I'll split off projects from it but the ultimate goal is to provide a author's publishing platform (self-publishing).

first, can you bundle that excellent into "Shore Project Overview" in Markdown so that I can download it. (And it's why I'm paying you the big bucks.)

No, got it myself, thanks.

What I want to do now is to build a Survey Builder that leverages what we've got in the polls app and the surveys app to allow us to build and deploy new surveys (from admin).

Yeah, I was getting to that but ENTER sends stuff to you and it's a new habit to learn SHIFT-ENTER when I want a newline. Sorry.
That's only part of it, though. When I'm done with that, I want to hive off the apps into a new project that I can deploy through Railway to one of my domains (probably foxxefrey.com or maybe a new one).
I figure we need to modularize this into Sections, be able to build a Section, save it and then slap them all together into a Survey.
We could have a Contact or Info section for when we want that. It would take the "card" format (e.g.: name which is Survey name, Label, Description). The Survey name would be the name of the instance of the class.

Hang on! each section works by adding polls to the basic card.

where do you propose this model lives? Should we combine the polls app and the surveys app into one app (seems possible)? Or could we make the Survey take a group of display objects (so that we can add more classes later). Should we create a Card that we can put at the top of Survey and abstract out the Survey concept? What do you think?

can you please wrap all this up into an "Project Shore - Architectural Discussion" in Markdown format?

let's go with your "short term" option.

This is what we've got, do we need to change our "import Question" to "import Question as Polls"?

  File "/home/todd/linux/src/shore/polls/admin.py", line 18, in <module>
    admin.site.register(Question, QuestionAdmin)
  File "/home/todd/linux/src/sandy/lib/python3.12/site-packages/django/contrib/admin/sites.py", line 130, in register
    raise AlreadyRegistered(msg)
django.contrib.admin.exceptions.AlreadyRegistered: The model Question is already registered in app 'polls'.

I think we should register in polls and fix what's in surveys

Okay, we've got that going. It's messy because we're running the new model with the old model.
Can you run me through the steps we'd take to make a new survey, "Books Loved"?

We have a "Survey" field, what do we do with that?

hmm... I'm in step 2, "Create Sections." The Section should not have a Survey associated with it as it's a one-to-many thing. How do we fix this?

how do we attach polls
Sections > Add Section

    Survey: [select “Books Loved”]

    Name: “Favorite Author Section”

    Attach Polls

surveys.Section_polls: (fields.E336) The model is used as an intermediate model by 'surveys.Section.polls', but it does not have a foreign key to 'Section' or 'Question'.

Hmm... when we did this my named sections lost their names and became "Section object (1)" etc.

  File "/home/todd/linux/src/shore/surveys/models.py", line 149, in __str__
    return f"{self.survey.title} - {self.section.label}"
                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AttributeError: 'Section' object has no attribute 'label'
[21/Jun/2025 01:56:19] "GET /admin/surveys/survey/2/change/ HTTP/1.1" 500 520586

Okay in the Admin panel "Questions" why do we have a questionnaire section? Aren't we creating generic Questions to attach to Sections?

Thanks, got it. We'll clean up later (gotta worry about the two older Surveys, "Survey <URL: http://localhost:8000/questionnaire/persquiz/>" and "Programming Experience <URL: http://localhost:8000/questionnaire/progexp/>"

shouldn't I be seeing the questions in this Section?

class SectionPollInline(admin.TabularInline):
    model = SectionPoll
    extra = 1

  File "/home/todd/linux/src/shore/polls/admin.py", line 18, in <module>
    class SectionPollInline(admin.TabularInline):
  File "/home/todd/linux/src/shore/polls/admin.py", line 19, in SectionPollInline
    model = SectionPoll

it would help if you give me a file reference when you're suggesting changes, as it was, I guessed. (Wrong)

Feedback -- the damned sidebar is constantly activating. Can we make it less annoying?

NOT Django -- you. Yours.

I'm not seeing this feedback button.

It is impossible to add a non-nullable field 'slug' to survey without specifying a default. This is because the database needs something to populate existing rows.
Please select a fix:
 1) Provide a one-off default now (will be set on all existing rows with a null value for this column)
 2) Quit and manually define a default value in models.py.

show me the script to populate slugs

It is impossible to change a nullable field 'slug' on survey to non-nullable without providing a default. This is because the database needs something to populate existing rows.
Please select a fix:
 1) Provide a one-off default now (will be set on all existing rows with a null value for this column)
 2) Ignore for now. Existing rows that contain NULL values will have to be handled manually, for example with a RunPython or RunSQL operation.
 3) Quit and manually define a default value in models.py.

next step is to build a form builder. I want to be able to see the existing Survey, SurveySection, SectionPoll, and Poll choices. I want to be able to create new ones as well and I want drag&drop functionality.

  File "/home/todd/linux/src/sandy/lib/python3.12/site-packages/django/contrib/admin/sites.py", line 130, in register
    raise AlreadyRegistered(msg)
django.contrib.admin.exceptions.AlreadyRegistered: The model Section is already registered with 'surveys.SectionAdmin'.

where do i see the drag&drop

check and see if I've got the SortableInlineAdminMixin in the right places, please

AssertionError: surveys.SurveyAdmin must inherit from SortableAdminBase since SurveySectionInline inherits from SortableInlineAdminMixin.

nope, no drag & drop

okay, walk me through how I should see these drag&drop features

nope, not working. Let's table this. 

hi, back again! looking at the tagger app in the pics project, I'm thinking we now need a global add/remove view. With this, you can select everything with a particular tag and remove that tag. The reason for this is that I'm pretty sure in our development the tag "digital" was mistakenly applied to over 100 images. Can we do this?

no, let's have a "remove all" and an individual "add" -- it's possible that some of the images were properly tagged, so the combined actions of removing all and adding one (or more) is quick and efficient

cool. but you gave me def bulk_tag_edit(request):
should I keep it or replace it?

can you wrap that bulk_remove_tag.html up in a more complete form that I can save as bulk_remove_tag.html

and what's the URL

no thanks. that'd just confuse things. We've got tagger as the first pass frontend, then bulk-remove-tag as a cleanup.

you know, what I want is some way to start up all the necessary dependencies *and* runserver. What do you got?

cute. but wrong. to get up and running, we need to start Redis, start the two Celery workers and then we can do runserver. *That's* the problem I want solved. Perhaps Docker is the right solution, though.

Django project folder is pics. Redis is 7.4. We also need a wrapper around this for starting the docker desktop on my Windows PC if I haven't already started that (that goes outside the Docker build, obviously). Can do?

docker-compose.yaml is a fine (and generic name). Should we go with something more project related? Maybe pics.compose.yaml? And can we include the file name is the file as an aide memoire?

where do we check to see if my (outside project) Docker Desktop is running? Or should we leave that just as a "learn the hard way" issue?

meta question -- while will EMACS never die? Calling it "nano" is just a cop out.

I'm a vi guy. Bleh on EMACS and all its descendants.

I've used "ed" <grin>. As for your offer, it's kindly meant but I'm not that much of a purist. I do, however, reserve the right to change my mind.

Thanks.

celerybeat-1  | ImportError: cannot import name 'tagger' from 'tagger.views' (/app/tagger/views.py)

good morning, what are we doing today

that's still the plan, let's clean up

i think we should remove def save_tag_ajax, we're not still using AJAX, are we?

what can go from tag_grid.html

show_export is gone.  Why are we using all_tags, aren't we getting everything from Redis?

yes, give me an updated "clean" version, please

I think we should change our logic a bit. Instead of 📥 Download CSV, let's not do that at all in tagging. We keep track of untagged Images and when they're all tagged, we get redirected to an "analysis" view which lists tags by order of selection and, gives us an analysis of our tag distribution and has a button download the CSV.  We should also be able to access that view on our own (and download the CSV as things stand). What do you think?

yes, let's put in that progress bar (great idea). and I'd like the analysis view and template, and the auto-redirect.

give me a full views.py, please

we're not showing all the images, just 20

No, there's no pagination, no "next page" etc. Let's fix that in the template, just like we had it before.

what i've got is:

    return render(request, 'tagger/tag_grid.html', {
        'page_obj': page_obj,
        'tag_data': tag_data,

still not showing pagination stuff.

hmm, we're working!
I'd like to automagically open the http://localhost:8000/pages/starter-tags/ in a new window whenever we get into this http://localhost:8000/tagger/ view, can we do that?

okay, cool but what happens when I deploy this? And hostname changes?

hey, did we still need this:
        function getJsonFromScript(scriptId) {
            let data = [];
            const scriptTag = document.getElementById(scriptId);
            if (scriptTag && scriptTag.textContent && scriptTag.textContent.trim()) {
                try {
                    data = JSON.parse(scriptTag.textContent);
                } catch (e) {
                    console.error(`Error parsing JSON from ${scriptId}:`, e);
                }
            }
            return data;

i can't tell if we're opening that new window, how do we debug it

no joy

well, the button works just fine

okay, it's a feature.
new problem.
The Apply these tags to selected images: isn't working.

give me a full copy of views.py with this integrated, please

still not working

i think the problem is here:
<input type="hidden" name="action" value="individual_save" id="form-action">

Not Found: /.well-known/appspecific/com.chrome.devtools.json

it's still not working. It worked before. Here's our current tag_grid.html and the old one from pics2.
One of the things I notice is that the input area is now a large textarea rather than a thin single line input.

give me the full template, please

that fixed it!
new problem -- when we go to page 2, we lose our tags

can you give me a new full template?

still not keeping the tags
http://localhost:8000/tagger/?page=2

aren't these values included already? Can't we get them from Redis? Why do we have to put them in the URL?

nah, i've got it. But why aren't we putting those values in the URL, then?

no results when searching for "pagination-link"

Okay, progress!
http://localhost:8000/tagger/?page=2&batch_tags=cover,scifi
BUT... we're only see "cover" on the "Apply these tags to selected images:" field (see file)

yay, it works!

question - why do we still have "Save Individual Tags" - do we need it?

Hmm... I'll consider it. Right now I think it's confusing.
Now... as we go through pages and pages, tagging items, it'd be nice if we had a count of the number of items tagged. Can do?

I was unclear.  
here, in tag_grid.html, we have a check box to select an image. I want to count each time we check that box and show the total boxes selected (the number of images which "Apply to Selected" will affect).

this needs to persist across pages, too

it's working. BUT what happened to graying out those tagged?

or are we not showing tagged images?

keep it as is. We've already got a "tagged' view.

well... I had thought that when I changed my tag selection, we'd reset the "Selected Images" to zero. can we do that?

i'm not quite sure it's working. I'm going to have to build some specific tests. (Later)

before we get to that, the analysis page is cool. BUT could we get some data somewhere to let us know how good our selections are? I mean there's got to be some sort of distribution of tags for good LLM training, right?

update to show me:If your dataset is imbalanced

Which tags are over- or under-used

How “healthy” your tag set is for ML/LLM purposes

no, we're good. we can add that later. This looks promising.

this project has a LOT of moving parts

nah, let's take a break.
Can you remember all this for when we come back to it?

the return render was the problem!
now, I want to add a total count at the top

why is my count 0?

okay, so tomorrow we need to remove all the cruft that we've got and move forward

remember this and remind me tomorrow

okay, where's the file?

the revised tag_grid.html

for comparison, this is what you're working from

do you recall the lengthy architecture discussion we had?


the current problem is that once images are tagged, that's all you see. you can't go to the next page, instead you get the list of the selected items. You promised a fix and then fainted.

let's get the example Python code

yeah, but we're not doing a POST
DEBUG: images.count = 2365
DEBUG: paginator.count = 2365
DEBUG: page_obj.object_list length = 20

[20/Jun/2025 01:25:47] "GET /tagger/?page=2&batch_tags=cover,scifi,exterior HTTP/1.1" 200 17634

okay, this all sucks!
let's change the underlying functionality,
how about we bring in Redis and write our tags to it? no more adding info to the URL

give me the view first, please

why is this here?
       'page_obj': page_obj,
        'all_tags_for_select2': [  # example; replace with your tags list
            {'id': 'cover', 'text': 'cover'},
            {'id': 'scifi', 'text': 'scifi'},
            {'id': 'exterior', 'text': 'exterior'},

Do I need a Docker command to run Redis

what is the latest version of Redis

what happens when we hit "Apply to Selected"

where do we update Image.tags for each Image?

here's what we've currently got for our Image and ImageTag and Tag classes

we're not getting to Redis.
we're never seeing the output of print("DEBUG: redis_client =", redis_client)

now shouldn't we do that automatically? (And when?)

Want the full signals.py code and how to register it?

both

how do we sync back from redis to the database and when?

Want a version that also updates your Image’s tags TextField?

want a version that does this as a periodic task

okay, build me a complete checklist for running this new setup

I want that in a Markdown file, please.

sadly, you dropped all the bullets. Can you try again?

Yeah  but we're not seeing all the images (3000+)

let's create a view that shows us only those Images with tags

going back to the color balance issue, you suggest something from opencv might work?

use this as a starter. Let's try CLAHE

I'm going to save the script as image_opencv.py

http://localhost:8000/tagger/, the bottom line is still not properly formatted

this is what we've got

corrected tag_grid.html

so how do I retrieve that tag_grid.html file into my pics2?

no, i meant back from git

diff these two files, the first is pics and the second is pics2

"Merge and give me new tag_grid.html"

yeah, not seeing any image, also we had green not blue labels

"yes — do it!"

time's up! Are you broken again?

post it here, to the screen. You have a bad history with ZIP

next message, really?

you did great! Now... can you make the line at the bottom, "<first> <previous>" etc blue like you had it before?

and the unselected  buttons were in outline form

beautiful!

sigh! after all this we were supposed to bring the set tags into the next page.

"yes — fix batch tags in pagination"

time's up, what gives?

Crud!  So I hit "Apply To Selected" and I get all the nicely grayed out guys but I can't go back to continue selection of other images.

1

wait a minute. When I'm done with one selection set, I need to be able to select another.
Example: I go through the "scifi" "cover" settings and now want to go select all the "female" "photo" set.  Are we able to do that or do we need more code?

do we need that? Or does the action of selecting new tags not signal that?

Okay, let's talk logic.  What we're trying to do is take several THOUSAND images. We need to do it quickly and clearly.  Our process is:
1. display images
2. allow tag selection (we should also display starter_tags.html in another window)
3. user selects a LOT of images but doesn't get them all for that tag set
4. so has to continue with that tag set
5. user saves the tagged images and we create the CSV
6. we type in new tags which automatically sets our application to a new tag set
7. the old tagged images are still displayed grayed out with their applied tags
8. the user repeats until all images are grayed out (selected).
how's that sound?

2

It's been 10 minutes (or more). You're not very good at keeping your word.

no change.

2

You're way over 2-3 mins

no. html is text

can you multitask

recall in the photo classifier we wanted to clean data, including running it through Photoshop with a script to auto-color. That script doesn't load. Is there any nice Python or Django package that could do auto-color instead?

well, we tried this but it did a terrible job. I wonder if we can do better

can you take your python file and have it take an file_name argument?

why does the script say "Gray World"? Is it applying ACE?

full script, ready-to-use, with ACE

 pip install ace-automatic-color-equalization
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement ace-automatic-color-equalization (from versions: none)

ImageMagick auto-color batcher (very easy to integrate)?

yay!

just tell me the mount command

wrong. got the old mount.

yes, got it

yes, save working flow as 'rclone mount'

give me the two shell scripts, please

does Photoshop have a headless version

photoshop supports scripts, right?

what I want to do is take a bunch of files and run Photoshop to run color balance, can do?

i want to recursively go through a directory

hmm... I'm going to import my Google drive images. I was planning on putting them in my WSL Ubuntu drive but can Photoshop access that?

yes, that's what I thought

how about if I go with E:\images

i have copy_images. py ready to go, right?

 python copy_images.py --source ~/google --target /mnt/e/Images --dry-run 
--log-file=logfile
Scanning source: /home/todd/google
Target directory: /mnt/e/Images
Dry run
Using 8 worker threads
============================================================

but I can't tell if it's doing anything

it's working!

now what was the name of the program I had you write to look at files named by date

can you give me file_date_sorter.py again

i think the version we settled on looked for more patterns

that worked great
now, should we improve it to create a directory structure and move the files to the new locations or should we create a separate python script to take the output and do that?

give me file_date_organizer.py, please

python file_date_organizer.py --dest /mmt/e/testImageDate --dry-run sorter.log
Reading list: sorter.log
Destination: /mmt/e/testImageDate
DRY-RUN enabled

are we recursively traversing the directory structure

got it, thanks

can you write a step-by-step outline in ACTIONS.md

Go1

okay, so photoshop doesn't seem to have a problem with \\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home, so let's write something that let's us recursively go through a directory, load all image files and apply white balance to them, outputing them to the <output> directory structure

yes, please give it to me. also with instructions on how to run it (under windows or wsl?)

Go!

keep JPG output only

Go ZIP!

let's write a python script that looks at images (JPG, PNG, BMP, TIF), reads their file info and flags any that might need to be rotated, outputting the results in a format that we could later feed into photoshop

Go!

are we having this problem again? Where's the ZIP file?

GitHub

generate the README.md

Go GitHub full

generate the .gitignore

let's get the requirements.txt

 git push --set-upstream origin main
remote: Repository not found.
fatal: repository 'https://github.com/todd427/copy_image_app.git/' not found

no, the project is called copy_image_app

my error, it should be copy_images_app

whew!

let's go

option A

Go UXP

Go generate UXP panel!

just remember the project name is "copy_images_app" (not my favorite name)

Go GitHub prep

you gotta give me the uxp-auto-color/ app

Go output UXP

generate .gitattributes

Go!

Go docs!

okay, let's talk about places where I can store static images and media for reference in my Django project

yeah, no. got all that. when i go into production, I'm going to need to place all that stuff with a CDN, give me some suggestions and pricing

why would I choose  Cloudflare R2 + CDN  over Bunny CDN

Go Bunny!

can you save all this info in a Markdown file, say BunnyGo.md?

what I want is something to take a directory, recursively traverse it, upload to Bunny, and generate a list of URL for access.

can we update this to include a --dry-run option?

Update BunnyGo.md and ACTIONS.md

give me ACTIONS.md

give me a downloadable ACTIONS.md

give me a downloadable BunnyGo.md

okay. do you recall my pics Django project?

I'm referring to: https://github.com/todd427/pics

The current problem is that when we run through tag_grid.html, we recall which images were already tagged but we don't include them when we generate the CSV.

wrong. you see the *previously* tagged images but when we tag more and then say Download to CSV, we only get the images we've tagged in this session, not the ones before.

Go CSV fix!

hm.. I gave you the file, please don't say "something like"

please use this file and show me the full patch

Go AJAX save

Go full AJAX patch!

Go full file!

give me the CSS tweak, please.

Go full with CSS!

what's the URL i need?

okay, that doesn't work, I've switched to "    path('save_tag_ajax/', save_tag_ajax, name='save_tag_ajax')," but my problem is what do I give a web browser to get where I want to go?

No. I mean I want to run my tagging URL

Page not found (404)
Request Method: 	GET
Request URL: 	http://localhost:8000/tag/

Using the URLconf defined in pics.urls, Django tried these URL patterns, in this order:

    admin/
    classifier/
    tagger/
    pages/
    ^media/(?P<path>.*)$

The current path, tag/, didn’t match any of these.

hmm... one of our git commits removed base.html, where was it and how do i get it back

can you instead tell me how to use git to go find it

is there a way to get git to show me all actions with just "base.html"

where should I put it? pics/templates pages/templates/pages templates

and we lost base.css

go fresh base.css!

Go fresh base.html

there are three static directories -- css, js... and what else

okay... so we got all that back but we still have this problem -- there's nothing coming up:

Go final views!

what we're getting is the images but none of the other stuff

I want to pull a full copy from git of the last commit, https://github.com/todd427/pics/commit/0e1f611d8099c5cc4046c5610e34fa834bbdfe36 -- how do I do that?

Go2

i want to start it in a new directory

git checkout -b recover-0e1f611

okay, I now have pics2 which is my last checkpoint and runs fine (ish). how do we reconcile it with the other version, pics

git diff pics2/recover-0e1f611..HEAD
fatal: ambiguous argument 'pics2/recover-0e1f611..HEAD': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.
Use '--' to separate paths from revisions, like this:

explain what "git remote add" does

okay we've got the non-working views.py from pics and the working views.py from pics2, we need to revise pics

Go final views! (without tag_drop_view)

hee-hee "File Not Found"
how about you write it out here

the first is the working tag_grid.html from pics2, the second is the current (pics) tag_grid.html which doesn't work. Fix.

Go next tag_grid~

getting better. We now get images, but they're full sized.
The CSS is missing. The top section (Download CSV) is missing.
It's a mess.

Hmm. so our "pics" version wants base.html but we actually didn't use it in the pics2 (older) version. Here's the two files (pics first, pics2 second).

Go next tag_grid!

Okay, I'm trying to get what was lost out of pics2 tag_grid.html and I've got this but the images aren't in a grid, what did I do wrong?

yes, prep it

much better! But we're still missing the formatting of the bottom of the page.
here's our current file and the old pics2 file.

Go next tag_grid! Full batch controls!

how are you feeling today?

well, if you look back, I was not too pleased with your ability to deliver results.

what I want to do now is build a new python app that looks at a directory on my Google drive for JPGs and other images (PNG, GIF, BMP, TIF) and recreates the directory structure with the images copied to a reference directory keeping the original directory structure. Can do?

I'm running this from WSL, skip duplicates, add a dry run, and let's see how good your ZIPing skills are today.

👍

let's add verbosity levels and log to a file

let's add multi-threaded copy for speed

how do I specify the Google Drive source?

 ls /mnt/g
ls: cannot access '/mnt/g': No such file or directory

how do I mount G: in wsl?

what does the gpt in chatgpt stand for

got it, thanks!

i'm going to want to add a mail server to my django project, which do you recommend?

yes, please

yes, wrap it up and put a bow on it

zip it up as a starter project

SendGrid is Twilio SendGrid, right

tell me how django_allauth links in with SendGrid

why would I want to integrate with the SendGrid API instead of SMTP

tell me more about SendGrid's dynamic templates

okay, do all three and zip it up

let me get both

how can we use smtp2go

yes, give me both

are you familiar with the smtp2go api

tell me more about mailgun

help me set up  a recurring newsletter campaign

no, I mean the actual content and deliveries

there are multiple audiences: L.A. Witch, Cody's War, Talla Hill's Ghost War, and the Canaris Rift

let

one master list (for now), branded HTML templates

todd@toddmccaffrey.com, the newsletter are going out with the WordPress newsletter plugin

give me the ZIP, please

roll!

why isn't the nav bar showing?

yes!

    Sign Up

Sign In Via Google

You are about to sign in using a third-party account from Google.

</div>

cool but still didn't fix the login problem

This -- <p>Welcome, {{ user.email }}.</p> isn't updating, why?

okay, cleared that problem, now i'm getting sent this this URL: http://localhost:8000/accounts/3rdparty/signup/

still broken

 python manage.py dbshell

nope, STILL broken!

Fixed!

okay, "Log Out" is higher than the rest on the nav bar:

      <div class="collapse navbar-collapse justify-content-end" id="navbarNav">

            </form>
          </li>

didn't work but why does it have to be a button, why not a link?

yes! fixed!

okay, so when I hover over a link on the menu, i want it to turn into a regular-looking blue link with underscore, can do?

okay let's add smtp2go

okay, how do i test my smtp2go user, and send a test email?

where is decouple

... subject="SMTP2GO test",
... message="it worked!",
... from_email="foxxe@foxxelabs.com",

235 Authentication succeeded, now what

let's make it Django test email

  File "/home/todd/linux/src/shore/pages/urls.py", line 11, in <module>
    path("test-email/", test_email_view, name="test_email"),
                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
NameError: name 'test_email_view' is not defined


Page not found (404)
Request Method: 	GET
Request URL: 	http://localhost:8000/test-email/

Using the URLconf defined in shore.urls, Django tried these URL patterns, in this order:

    [name='home']
    polls/
    admin/
    accounts/
    pages/
    surveys/
    questionnaire/

The current path, test-email/, didn’t match any of these.

❌ Email failed: (535, b'Incorrect authentication data')

YES! Okay, now what?

how do I remove files from git

okay now that I can login with Google SSO, how do I get to Sign Up with Google SSO


Okay, can we make the labels the same size:

<div class="d-flex flex-wrap gap-3 mt-3">
  <a class="btn btn-primary" href="{% provider_login_url 'google' method='oauth2' %}?prompt=select_account">Log in with Google</a>
  <a class="btn btn-outline-success" href="{% provider_login_url 'google' process='signup' %}" class="btn btn-success">
    Sign Up with Google
  </a>
</div>
  <div class="d-flex flex-wrap gap-3 mt-3">
    <a class="btn btn-outline-primary" href="{% url 'account_login' %}">Login</a>
    <a class="btn btn-outline-success" href="{% url 'account_signup' %}">Sign Up</a>
  </div>

nope.  still not aligned nor the same size.

let's add the Google 'G' icons

cool but now the regular "Login" and "Sign Up" are on two lines and taking the full width

let's make the two Google labels just wide enough to fit the text

flush left and all columns aligned, please

not flush left with the side of the page

put a gap between the login and sign up

i wasn't clear. i want the "login" and "sign up" to have gaps between them

what does this do

so if i want to add padding, do i change px-0 to something else, say px-20

how do i add a welcome message to new users?

no, meant an email message

remember that I already have an adapter in use

what's the command to see all the templates used

something to do with get_template

isn't there a get_template().all()

yes, let's write list_templates

open the "shore - Django app" project

there was a python command to list all templates, using get_template(), what is it

where is this coming from: base.html (remove before production)

in ubuntu, how do i change the colors used in 'ls -color'

explain - export LS_COLORS="di=1;34:ln=1;36:so=1;35:pi=1;33:ex=1;32:*.txt=1;31"

is there an app that let's us see and change these values

my directories are bold blue on a green background, what's the DIRCOLORS code for thawt

didn't work; trying to set my directories to regular blue with no background

regenerate a correct version

okay, weird. I've applied all that. A directory with mode 700 appears okay but one with mode 777 still has a green background

give me the updated version

yes, let's add number of responses

how do i get to the results

let's add a link to the admin list view

should this - views.results_dashboard_view - be views.results_dashboard

Is this going to work:from . import views

it's got the wrong form information, it's a copy of the persquiz

nah, it's still bullshit

build out the other parts

why is it taking us to the thank you page?

let's do it

        ("Not confidently", "Not confidently"),
    ]
    algorithms = forms.ChoiceField(label="Can you implement basic algorithms?", choices=ALGORITHMS)

woohoo!

let's get dashboard/export

do i have to migrate to get the new files in

okay, so how do I test this

yes

what's the command to take the test

no, not that. I meant to take the questionaire

we started with those files and we were going load the date into the question modules

python manage.py load_questions
usage: manage.py load_questions [-h] [--version] [-v {0,1,2,3}] [--settings SETTINGS] [--pythonpath PYTHONPATH]
                                [--traceback] [--no-color] [--force-color] [--skip-checks]

manage.py load_questions: error: the following arguments are required: json_path, code, title, description

okay, we not only needed the questions from question.json but also the age ranges from the index.html I uploaded

actually the ages are in the models.py

woohoo! Marvelous!

first, how do i use it? What's the URL to take the test?

the slug code should be persquiz not feyman, how do we change that

I need to change the title and also remove the subtext, how

here's the settings, it should work

that was it, needed the crispy_forms_tags

wire up the POST to store the data, and increment duplicate UUID, so it's +1... etc

does this replace or append to the views.py file?

we have questionnaire not take_questionnaire

where do I go to look at the results

(sandy) todd@mona:~/linux/src/shore$

give me the full corrected test, please

help me find which VPN is running on my laptop

 cp index.html $(dirs +1)/lander.html
cp: cannot create regular file '~/linux/src/shore/templates/lander.html': No such file or directory

how to eval $(dirs +1) into a fully qualified path

it's not working. the directory is there, what's up

echo $(dirs +1)
~/linux/src/shore/templates
(sandy) todd@mona:/mnt/e/src/lander$ realpath $(dirs +1)
realpath: '~/linux/src/shore/templates': No such file or directory

okay, so let's make the "(eval echo...) into an alias so that I can do this with any command and any dir

I don't like the {}, is there a way around that?

how do I load CSS

can you force a stylesheet to be unloaded

what's so good about a passkey

Okay, I want to take these questions and turn them into a quiz that I can use in my Dajngo project

okay, incorporate this in, too. including age and the quasi-uuid

I don't see the age list, where is it

let's change it into a Django form-based quiz page. In fact, let's create a django app to handle many types of forms, of which is just one

let's change the name from "Feyman-Heisenberg" to "Feynman-Drummelberg"

yes please

I'd like a results dashboard and CSV export of results

what's the <code> reference?

got it

what do i need to add to my settings.py file

create both a script and a management command to load the questions

how do i test to ensure that migrate shell script worked

what about using get_template

 git commit -m"moved html files to /template"
On branch main
Your branch and 'origin/main' have diverged,
and have 1 and 2 different commits each, respectively.

nothing to commit, working tree clean

how come I need "pages/home.html" and just "about.html" works? from django.views.generic import TemplateView

class HomePageView(TemplateView):
    template_name = 'pages/home.html'

class AboutPageView(TemplateView):
    template_name = 'about.html'

what's the import line to load get_template

what are the attributes of a template

>>> from django.template.loader import get_template
>>> get_template('home.html')

this is shore/urls.py

still not working - here's shore/urls.py and pages/urls.py

let's rename the namespace

what's some good  content for my about page. I'm using Bootstrap

can you built me tests to add to my pages/test.py for the About page and the Bootstrap changes?

add a print to let me know the class of test and each individual test

okay, i've changes pages/tests.py, how do i get git to pick up the change

that didn't change anything in the repo

git commit -m"updated pages/tests.py"
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean

the file is in the repo but it doesn't show the commit message. the file itself is changed.

 file pages/tests.py
pages/tests.py: Python script, ASCII text executable

git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   pages/tests.py

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

okay, so that worked. why didn't it work earlier when I did: 1) git add .; 2) git commit -m"meesage"; 3) git push


Page not found (404)
Request Method: 	GET
Request URL: 	http://localhost:8000/accounts/login/signup/

Using the URLconf defined in shore.urls, Django tried these URL patterns, in this order:

    [name='home']
    admin/
    accounts/ login/ [name='login']
    accounts/ logout/ [name='logout']
    accounts/ signup/ [name='signup']
    pages/

The current path, accounts/login/signup/, didn’t match any of these.

You’re seeing this error because you have DEBUG = True in your Django settings file. Change that to False, and Django will display a standard 404 page.

how do i get the powershell version

PSVersion says that I've got 5.1.26100 but I've installed Powershell 7.5.1, what gives?

okay, I'm trying to consolidate so that all my apps look to templates/base.html for the base.html file. I get this:TemplateDoesNotExist at /

i want to have base.html be in pages/templates/pages/, how do we do that

can you make me tests for this new directory

where can i get a good pic of me online

[11/Jun/2025 17:25:50] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 283
[11/Jun/2025 17:25:50] "GET /static/images/todd.jpg HTTP/1.1" 404 1859

remember the logos we made?

which project did we put them in

Brand Identity

generate SVG/PNG logo again

nah, make it Foxxe Frey Labs (three lines). Also, a cooler logo.

 could you build me a Django project that can take an author's name and produce a list of ASINS and ISBNs of their titles?

both, search box = result list UI, save to database, add the ability to go from ISBN/ASIN to purchase URLs, scrape price

proceed

tell me more about deploying to Railway

add the required Railway files to the current zip

how do you add themes to django projects?

tell me more about bootstrap and tailwind

what about crispy

add crispy-forms with Bootstrap to my bookfinder project

where is the best place to go for domain names

okay, got it to work, thanks!

what i need is a really good domain name that's not expensive, any suggestions

thanks. I was thinking more for me, as an author/artist/creative/engineer

tobotic is good, how about with software

no, let's move off tobotic but keep it in mind, again something that reflects a creative, a NYT beslselling author, and an artist with an MFA and a software engineer with 50 years of experience

tjm.dev is taken

i bought foxxefrey.com

design a logo and favicon

nice but you've got two f's. It should be: Foxxe Frey, split on two lines

use orange and blue complements

i want to pull a chapter into a new directory from git, how

how do i roll back to the latest git version

okay, got this, what's it mean?

extract and summarize the actual traceback

new error

AssertionError: Cannot apply DjangoModelPermissions on a view that does not set `.queryset` or have a `.get_queryset()` method.

MY music player, AIMP has randomized every track in every album. I don't have shuffle on. how do i fix this?

how do you delete a playlist

okay, i unked all the files in the AIMP/PLS directory and it's still shuffling the tracks. is there some global setting I need to fix?

okay you're out of date on this app. there is no Playback > Playback Options. I'm running v5.40.2675

with wsl, how do I set a .bashrc that's executed on entry

Cursor keeps hanging when open some files for a while then recovers. what's up?

[10/Jun/2025 00:27:28] "GET /api/subjects/ HTTP/1.1" 500 101194

i'm working with Django 5 by example. I'm on Chapter 12. How do I add subjects on the CLI

let's preload a bunch of subjects - Mathematics, Music, Physics, Programming

Great! Now, I want to create a 101 course for each of the previous subjects


yes, let's add a Welcome module


can you switch this to a migration format


okay, let's make a migration that creates 101 Modules for each course (e.g.: History 101) and adds a Welcome module for each


oops!

Request Method: 	GET
Request URL: 	http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/coupons/coupon/add/
Raised by: 	django.contrib.admin.sites.catch_all_view

Using the URLconf defined in myshop.urls, Django tried these URL patterns, in this order:

    admin/ [name='index']
    admin/ login/ [name='login']
    admin/ logout/ [name='logout']
    admin/ password_change/ [name='password_change']
    admin/ password_change/done/ [name='password_change_done']
    admin/ autocomplete/ [name='autocomplete']

    admin/ shop/category/
    admin/ shop/product/
    admin/ ^(?P<app_label>auth|orders|shop)/$ [name='app_list']
    admin/ (?P<url>.*)$

The current path, admin/coupons/coupon/add/, matched the last one.

You’re seeing this error because you have DEBUG = True in your Django settings file. Change that to False, and Django will display a standard 404 page.

that got it!

my Django project said this: Reason given for failure:

    CSRF token from POST incorrect.
    

In general, this can occur when there is a genuine Cross Site Request Forgery, or when Django’s CSRF mechanism has not been used correctly. For POST forms, you need to ensure:

    Your browser is accepting cookies.
    The view function passes a request to the template’s render method.
    In the template, there is a {% csrf_token %} template tag inside each POST form that targets an internal URL.
    If you are not using CsrfViewMiddleware, then you must use csrf_protect on any views that use the csrf_token template tag, as well as those that accept the POST data.
    The form has a valid CSRF token. After logging in in another browser tab or hitting the back button after a login, you may need to reload the page with the form, because the token is rotated after a login.

**Background:** I'm creating a blog using Django along with the library `django-taggit` for tagging my blog posts.

**Goal:**  I want to extend the sitemap functionality to include URLs for each tag used in the blog, effectively listing posts filtered by those tags in the `sitemap.xml`.

**Here's what I've done so far:**
- I've got a sitemap set up for the posts using Django's sitemap framework.
- I've made URL patterns that allow viewing posts filtered by tags.
- I want to add these tag-filtered views to my sitemap but I'm not sure how.

**Here’s some of my existing setup:**

For the posts' sitemap: `blog/sitemaps.py`
```
from django.contrib.sitemaps import Sitemap
from .models import Post


class PostSitemap(Sitemap):
    changefreq = 'weekly'
    priority = 0.9

    def items(self):
        return Post.published.all()

    def lastmod(self, obj):
        return obj.updated
```

The URL pattern for listing posts by a tag: `blog/urls.py`
```
urlpatterns = [
    # ...
    path('tag/<slug:tag_slug>/', views.post_list, name='post_list_by_tag'),
]
```

And the main site's URL configuration: `mysite/urls.py`
```
from django.contrib import admin
from django.contrib.sitemaps.views import sitemap
from django.urls import include, path
from blog.sitemaps import PostSitemap

sitemaps = {
    'posts': PostSitemap,
}

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('blog/', include('blog.urls', namespace='blog')),
    path(
        'sitemap.xml',
        sitemap,
        {'sitemaps': sitemaps},
        name='django.contrib.sitemaps.views.sitemap',
    ),
]
```

Please, explain the necessary changes to the code, to add tag pages to the sitemap.

great! we passed! Now, tell me what to do on the running mysite website to verify the functionality.

i want to show the tags in the blog post

help me upload a file

convert the story in the file to Final Draft .fdx screenplay format

show me the converted screen play

no, i want you to switch the format to screenplay format.  Please show me the output

this is still not screenplay format.

yes and both .fdx and .pdf

i need you to provide a complete translation, both .fdx and .pdf

that was wrong, the pdf is corrupted, please fix for both

the output is still wrong. how about you show me your proposed output?

that does not match proper screenplay format

use this file instead; you STILL have not translated it properly into screenplay format.

well, you completely BLEW the PDF formatting, for starters.

nope, still not encoded properly

it's not readable, you've not encoded it into a proper pdf file

here is an example of your output:Times New Roman;Symbol;Arial; ;;;; heading 1; heading 2;
heading 3; heading 4;
heading 5; heading 6;\* WidthB0WidthB3Normal Table; Title;

here's the .docx format, now create the screenplay

Convert the story into proper screenplay structure:

    SCENE HEADINGS

    CHARACTER NAMES (centered)

    DIALOGUE (indented)

    ACTION (block paragraphs)

Output as a clean, professional screenplay PDF.

this is not properly formatted with Scene Heading, Centered  Character Names, Indented Dialogue, Bock-style Action lines.

This has NOT been properly converted. Please fix and output to the screen

yes, please

the pdf output is still wrong, no scene heading, no centered character names, no properly indented dialogue, no block-style action lines.

yes, that works. Apply the formatting

you didn't provide the rendering, it's still the original text. Please put it in a different PDF file, too. Call it WISMC

sadly, not translated into screenplay format with ✅ Scene Headings

✅ Centered Character Names

✅ Indented Dialogue

✅ Block-style Action Paragraphs

the sample is correct. can you do it to the entire script and generate a complete PDF

No, you merely reproduced the original format, you did not transformed using the verified screenplay formatting:

    Scene Headings

    Centered Character Names

    Indented Dialogue

    Block-style Action Paragraphs

📄 Download Full WISMC Screenplay – Properly Formatted PDF

again, no. You have not provided ✅ Scene Headings

✅ Centered Character Names

✅ Indented Dialogue

✅ Block-style Action Paragraphs

nope, still wrong

yes, that works. Now the trick is  can you apply the transformation to the entire screenplay (so far you've failed at least 3 times)

nope, once again you blew it

yes. include scene headings. make narrator's voice action blocks. Give this a try

yes but output to screen first

yes, then show me the output

you need to do better on the character names. Also, show me the FULL script.

clean up, output to screen

finalize, assign reasonable defaults and output to screen

no! I want all the output here, to the screen, as output I can copy. You SUCK at generating PDF output

export entire screenplay as downloadble .txt

you don't have scene headings and you've done a horrible job of guessing character names

yes

the list is correct, so is the breakdown

that's not the complete screenplay. The complete screenplay should be about 13 pages long.

This version is still using "I" for MARK and "HE" for COP. This is really something you're having trouble with, isn't it?

re-uploaded. You are go for the manual rewrite line-by-line.

looking good! please download as a .txt file

let's download as a PDF. And... well done!

i'd like a pdf

write the code to add Posts to my Django project

django.core.exceptions.FieldError: 'published' cannot be specified for Post model form as it is a non-editable field

It is impossible to add a non-nullable field 'slug' to post without specifying a default. This is because the database needs something to populate existing rows.

I'm having trouble using Django's send_mail() function.  I get the following error:

MeU
A dedicated host to provide categorized (bloggish) posts to invited friends.  This is a “look into my mind” sort of thing. It goes one way -- from me to you (hence the name).
Friends could be authorized to create their own MeU stack (and I could then be invited to it).
The inspiration for this is the failure of both Substack and Wordpress to allow remote posting and dedicated posting.

Components
The basic “post”
I have in mind some sort of JSON object with TITLE, CATEGORY, BODY.  All this could be displayed (via Javascript?) on a browser (HTML).
The Server
The server accepts posts and stores them for viewing.
The server handles login/authentication and keeps track of interactions (posts read, etc.)
The server provides a high-level view of the posts and categories in a tree format (“All” being the root).
The Viewer. This is the app that allows people to view posts and select categories to view (and be informed of additions to).
The Writer. This is the app (or superset of Viewer?) that allows the owner (me) to create new posts and new categories (and, perhaps, hide/archive both?)

You're a professional developer highly skilled in debugging. The user ran the textdoc's code, and an error was thrown.
Please think carefully about how to fix the error, and then rewrite the textdoc to fix it.

- NEVER change existing test cases unless they're clearly wrong.
- ALWAYS add more test cases if there aren't any yet.
- ALWAYS ask the user what the expected behavior is in the chat if the code is not clear.

# Hint

The error occurs because `db.create_all()` is being called outside of the application context. To fix this, you should wrap the `db.create_all()` call inside an application context like this:

```python
with app.app_context():
    db.create_all()
```

This ensures that the `db.create_all()` function has access to the current application instance.


# Error

RuntimeError: Working outside of application context.

This typically means that you attempted to use functionality that needed
the current application. To solve this, set up an application context
with app.app_context(). See the documentation for more information.

# Hint

The error likely occurs because the `_multiprocessing` module is missing or unavailable in the sandboxed environment you're running the code in. This module is required for Flask's debugging tools to function correctly, as they rely on multiprocessing for certain operations like interactive debugging. 

Since you mentioned that the environment is sandboxed, you might be unable to resolve this issue by modifying the environment itself, so it may be necessary to run the app in a different, more permissive environment where the required dependencies are available.

Here’s a mnemonic to remember the **four phases of menstruation**—**Menstrual, Follicular, Ovulation, Luteal**—including **physical and mood** aspects:

---

### 🩸 **Mnemonic: "My Funny Owl Laughs"**

* **M** — **Menstrual**
  *Mood:* Tired, introverted
  *Physical:* Bleeding, cramps
  🔹 *“My” reminds you it’s personal and introspective.*

* **F** — **Follicular**
  *Mood:* Energized, hopeful, motivated
  *Physical:* Period ends, estrogen rises
  🔹 *“Funny” matches the upbeat mood.*

* **O** — **Ovulation**
  *Mood:* Social, confident, flirty
  *Physical:* Fertile, discharge increases, mild pelvic pain
  🔹 *“Owl” is wise and aware—like peak intuition and clarity here.*

* **L** — **Luteal**
  *Mood:* Irritable, anxious, moody (esp. premenstrual)
  *Physical:* Bloating, fatigue, cravings
  🔹 *“Laughs” ironically hints at mood swings and PMS tension.*

# Hint

The error likely occurs because the `form[`q${i+1}`]` line tries to access form elements that don't exist. This could be caused by the form elements not being fully rendered or the dynamic creation of select options being out of sync with the query. Ensure that the dynamic HTML elements (the question selects) are properly generated before the `calculateResults()` function attempts to access them. You might want to check that the `window.onload` function is correctly setting up all form elements before they are accessed.

I need a cover design for a thriller novel titled "Rocket City." The setting is a rainy, rural Ireland and the story involves the transport of two nuclear warheads concealed in coffins. The main characters are a group of spies, government agents, and an unlikely civilian who are racing against time to deliver the warheads to Ukraine.
I want the cover to convey a sense of mystery, danger, and urgency. Here are some elements to consider:
●
Image: A shadowy figure in a trench coat standing in the rain, looking down at two freshly dug graves. In the background, a silhouette of a traditional Irish farmhouse. [Our Conversation]
●
Color Scheme: Use dark greens, grays, and blues to reflect the Irish landscape and the novel's somber mood. Add a splash of red, perhaps as a glow emanating from the graves, to symbolize the hidden danger. [Our Conversation]

Xiomara (‘syo-MA-ra’)
	I was in the kitchen, reading the letter when the knock came on my door. I got up and went into the front room. I ignored the kid sitting quietly in the corner.
	There was a buff, blond man with blue eyes standing on the steps. When he saw me, he said, “Dolores Hernandez?”
	I shook my head, “She was my aunt.”
	“Was?” the man said, his eyes widening. “I was told --”
	“She’s been gone for ten days,” I told him. Ten days, four hours, and… thirty-five minutes. Tia.
	The man looked disappointed. “Can I come in?”
	I cocked my head to the side. Then I shook it. He sighed and pulled out his badge. “This is official police business.”
	I’d figured that. No way a white guy comes into the neighborhood without a good reason. And the killings two blocks over ten days ago were a really good reason. The news said it was gangs.
	I could argue with him, demand he get a warrant but… I shrugged and waved him to a seat at the front table.  I went around and sat behind it. There was a deck of Tarot cards on my left side. Tia’s cards.  They were pristine. The bullet hadn’t struck them. No, the stray bullet had entered her just above the sternum, passed through to the far side but not before it nicked the artery and she bled out.  The card on the table when they found her was Death, of course.
	The cop sat.  He glanced over to the girl in the corner. “Can we talk alone?”
	My eyes widened. Didn’t he know not to…? The girl stood up and walked out of the room.  She avoided the kitchen, walked to the bedroom, to the lounge, and then slammed the bathroom door shut.

That there were dragons trapped underneath our school.  We freed them.  And the two dragons had lots of baby dragons -- twenty-eight in all.  I got one.
	Do you know why witches fly brooms?  It’s because it’s too hard to ride an invisible dragon.  You need something you can see and hold on to or you’ll fall off.
	Not long after we freed the dragons, we discovered that there was a group of people sworn to destroy all witches.  They’re called ‘The Order’ and they know about us now.
