Gemma would die but everyone else would decide that Jaxom was dead\r\ntoo until Lessa, grieving, discovers that the baby is alive.\r\n\r\nShe takes Jaxom partly in pennance but also because they become each\r\nother's alibi - Lessa can't be a child if she's just given birth and Jaxom\r\ncan't be Gemma's if he's got a mother.\r\n\r\nFax, in his rage, kills the watch-wher and has its head mounted above the\r\nhearth.\r\n\r\nLessa raises Jaxom so now, when she's 21, he's 10.\r\n\r\nWhen the dragonriders arrive on Search, they discount Lessa because she's\r\n\"too old\"."

Perhaps a different way of resolving \u201cties\u201d could be used?\r\n(Example: what if the high-point person always lost?)"

    "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nHe's alive but apparently flew 20 feet in the air before landing on the \r\nground.   They took him to USC (which is odd because he was on his way \r\nto an appointment at the Children's Hospital in LA).  He had a fracture \r\nof both the tibia and fibula and scrapes and bruises all over the \r\nplace.  He's up in the ICU at the moment (fingers crossed).\r\n\r\nHowever, working on the presumption that all goes well, he'll be on \r\ncrutches when he gets out, which is going to make getting him to classes \r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\nAll of which is preparatory to asking: would it be possible to switch \r\nfrom the 8:45 class to the 12:45 class?\r\n(It may be that I have to drop all 3 of my classes to deal with the \r\nkidlet, as we've got a second floor apartment.)\r\n\r\n-- Todd"

    "body": "1. What is User Acquisition?\r\n\r\nUser acquisition is the process by which a new user is acquired.  It could\r\ncome from providing a demo of the game, providing some level of free play\r\nor using other incentives.\r\n\r\n2. What is Monetization?\r\n\r\nMonetization is the process of determining the average amount of income\r\nfrom each customer.  Not all customers will be paying customers,\r\nmonetization allows a developer to get a feel for overall revenue from a\r\nparticular product.\r\n\r\n3. What is the theory of the Long Tail?\r\n\r\nThe theory of the Long Tail is that there are a category of long-term\r\ncustomers who will remain with a product for a great length of time and\r\nthat their overall purchases can exceed the near-term revenue."
